Abstract: Tailed radio galaxies are powerful tracers of interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the intracluster medium (ICM), providing unique insights into cluster dynamics. We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) 144 MHz and uGMRT 400 MHz observations of the cluster MACS J1354.6+7715 (z = 0.3967) to investigate the radio emission associated with its member galaxies and the cluster environment. The dominant tailed radio galaxy in the cluster exhibits a sharply bent tail extending over approximately 300 kpc, with the spectral index steepening from approximately -0.46 +/- 0.21 near the AGN core to approximately -2.43 +/- 0.30 in the outermost regions. Synchrotron modelling of the tail yields a radiative age of 150 +/- 10 Myr, implying a galaxy velocity of 1956 +/- 130 km s^-1, which is of order ~ 0.9 times the escape velocity. We find no evidence of relics or halos in our radio images, and the X-ray morphology from Chandra appears relatively undisturbed, suggesting that the system is a pre-merging candidate. Our results indicate that the radio galaxy is undergoing its first infall into the cluster, providing an excellent laboratory for studying the impact of the ICM on AGN activity and galaxy evolution, and demonstrating how multi-frequency radio observations of tailed galaxies can uniquely probe both AGN lifecycles and the early stages of cluster assembly.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04962v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Searching for gravitational waves from compact binary mergers powering long gamma-ray bursts during LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O3 run</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05169</link><description>arXiv:2602.05169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star binary mergers are often associated with short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the recent detection of kilonovae coincident with long GRBs suggest that some mergers may produce long GRBs. Motivated by these developments, we perform a search for binary neutron star and neutron star-black hole gravitational-wave signals coincident with long GRBs using data from the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) observing run. We analyze LVK data coincident with long GRBs detected by Fermi's GRB Monitor and Swift's Burst Alert Telescope when at least two gravitational-wave observatories were running. We find no evidence of a coincident gravitational-wave signal and set limits on the luminosity distance to each of these long GRBs under the assumption that they were powered by binary mergers.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05169v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Evolution of cataclysmic variables under different magnetic braking prescriptions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05260</link><description>arXiv:2602.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The evolution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) - interacting binaries where a low-mass donor transfers matter to a white dwarf via an accretion disk - is critically controlled by magnetic braking (MB). Significant uncertainties persist regarding how distinct MB formalisms influence CV evolutionary pathways.
  Aims. We performed systematic simulations of CV evolution under five MB prescriptions using the MESA code: the classical Skumanich law and the Matt, Reiners &amp; Mohanty (RM12), intermediate, and convection-boosted formalisms. Primary objectives included investigating their impact on orbital period distributions, mass-transfer rates, donor star evolution, and period gap characteristics.
  Methods. Evolutionary sequences were computed across all MB frameworks. We analyzed their effects on key observables: orbital period evolution, accretion rates, and period gap morphology.
  Results. Magnetic braking prescription selection fundamentally determines whether CV systems develop the characteristic period gap. The intermediate prescription provides optimal consistency with observations of nonmagnetic CVs, simultaneously reproducing the gap location and donor properties. Strong braking models (e.g., Skumanich) produce clear detachment phases, while self-consistent regulation models (Matt12 and RM12) maintain weak angular momentum loss and fail to form a gap, making them more prone to magnetic CVs.
  Conclusions. The presence or absence of the period gap is primarily governed by the strength and behavior of MB before the donor becomes fully convective. Future studies must further incorporate the regulatory effects of magnetic fields on donor structure to accurately predict the period distribution characteristics of magnetic CVs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05260v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] IFU Spectroscopic Study of the Planetary Nebula Abell 30: Mapping the Ionisation and Kinematic Structure of the Inner Complex</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05277</link><description>arXiv:2602.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents integrated flux and velocity channel maps of the planetary nebula Abell 30 (A30) inner knot system. The observations were taken with the INTEGRAL spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope (WHT). Our IFU data cube partially covers knots J1, J2, and completely covers knots J3, J4 in the system. Optical Recombination Lines of C II, He I, He II, N III, O II and Collisionally Excited Lines of [Ar IV], [Ar V], [N II], [Ne III], [Ne IV], and [O III] were detected. Our integrated flux maps visualise the ionisation structure and the chemical inhomogeneity in the system previously reported by other groups. We find that ORLs are concentrated in the polar region (J1, J3), whereas the equatorial knots (J2, J4) are dominated by CELs. The flux ratio map of the diagnostic [O III] lambda 5007/4363 Angstrom lines reveals the electron temperature distribution, which shows cold cores of 15,000 K in knots J3 and J4 surrounded by a hot outer layer of above 20,000 K. Our channel maps show positive and negative velocity excursions from the systemic value among the ions. Several ions show variation in their velocity structures from their lower-energy-level counterparts, including [Ar IV] and [Ar V], [Ne III] and [Ne IV], and He I and He II. New recurrent velocity structures are identified in the low-density regions where the ions move much faster compared to their surrounding environments. The velocity dispersion measurements highlight extreme turbulence in some of the ions (sigma_vrad approx 140 km/s), consistent with supersonic/hypersonic motion driven by shocks. The forbidden line species [N II] exhibits lower turbulence (sigma_vrad approx 50-60 km/s), tracing denser, less-turbulent gases. Based on our data, we conclude both the ionisation and kinematic studies hint at shock heating and multiple ejection history in the evolutionary pathway of A30.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05277v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] An Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock Model for Long GRBs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05278</link><description>arXiv:2602.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Accretion-Modulated Internal Shock model (AMIS) as a possible framework for explaining the observational properties of long gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission. In this scenario, the envelope of the prompt light curve follows the time-dependent mass-supply history to the central engine, associated with stellar collapse and, where applicable, fallback accretion, whose early-time onset can be approximated by $\dot{M}\propto t^{0-1/2}$ and which subsequently may decay as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-5/3}$, producing a photon count rate with a single fast-rise-exponential-decay (FRED)-like profile. In general, the prompt-emission envelope is regulated by a time-dependent mass supply to the central engine, while internal shocks produce the rapid variability. Since we only aim to introduce this framework here, we focus on the simplest single-FRED shape of the prompt emission profiles, while more complex cases involving multiple episodes and interacting shocks will be explored in forthcoming studies. The model indicates correlations between spectral evolution, FRED-pulse narrowing at high energies, and the mass-supply-controlled envelope. Stochastic Lorentz factor variations of ejected mass- or rate-driven shells, superimposed on the Accretion-Modulated envelope, explain the coexistence of smooth global trends and irregular short-timescale features, such as the widths of individual pulses in long GRB light curves, offering diagnostic tools for probing the inner engine activity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05278v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The sub-arcsecond ILT view of the Bo\"{o}tes Deep Field: A link between low-frequency kiloparsec radio morphology and AGN driven ionised outflows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05318</link><description>arXiv:2602.05318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) outflows can regulate host galaxy evolution via AGN feedback. Ionised gas outflows have been linked to enhanced radio emission. In the first paper of this series, AGN detected with the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) at 6" were more likely to host an [O III] 5007 outflow than AGN not detected, although only high-powered jets were ruled out as the origin of radio emission. New wide-field, sub-arcsecond resolution imaging at 144 MHz with the ILT now enables a resolved morphological study of this sample. We present the first wide-field, sub-arcsecond images of the Bo\"otes Deep Field at 144 MHz, detecting 4074 sources in the $\sim$0.3" image with a central sensitivity of 33.8 uJy $\mathrm{beam^{-1}}$. For 47 AGN matched in AGN luminosity, we probe radio emission on kiloparsec-scales to investigate correlations with [O III] outflows. This sample spans $z&lt;0.83$, $10^{40}&lt;10^{43}~\mathrm{erg~s^{-1}}$, and $10^{21}&lt;10^{24.5}~\mathrm{W~Hz^{-1}}$. We find that if we detect an AGN on both large-scales (6") and small-scales (0.3"), 90$\pm$7 per cent have an [O III] outflow, compared to 63$\pm$9 per cent of sources detected on large-scales, but undetected on small-scales. Furthermore, 17$\pm$6 per cent of sources without an [O III] outflow are detected on kiloparsec-scales, compared to 51$\pm$12 per cent of sources with an [O III] outflow. This implies a connection between [O III] outflows and kiloparsec-scale radio emission, which is likely AGN-driven. In contrast, AGN without an [O III] outflow are dominated by diffuse radio emission, likely to be associated with star formation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05318v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Double-Burst Nature and Early Afterglow Evolution of Long GRB 110801A</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05404</link><description>arXiv:2602.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 110801A, utilizing multi-band data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based telescopes. The $\gamma$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $\gamma$-rays at $\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $\gamma$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components. We constrain the key physical parameters of the burst, deriving an initial Lorentz factor $\Gamma_0 \sim 60$, a jet half-opening angle $\theta_j \sim 0.09$, and an isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\rm k,iso} \sim 10^{54.8}$ erg.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05404v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Effects of Dynamo-Generated Large-Scale Magnetic Fields on the Surface Gravity ($f$) Mode</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05529</link><description>arXiv:2602.05529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By modelling the upper layers of the Sun in terms of a two-layer setup where a free-surface exists within the computational domain, we numerically study the interaction between the surface gravity, or the fundamental ($f$) mode, and the magnetic fields. Earlier such works were idealized in the sense that the static magnetic fields were imposed below the photosphere, i.e., the free-surface, to detect signatures of sub-surface magnetic fields and flows on the $f$-mode. In this work, we perform three-dimensional (3D) numerical simulations where the interior fluid below the photosphere is stirred helically at small scales, thus facilitating an $\alpha^2$-dynamo. This allows us to investigate how these self-consistently generated large-scale magnetic fields influence the properties of the $f$-mode. We find that when the magnetic fields saturate near the equipartition values with the turbulent kinetic energy of the flow, the $f$-mode is significantly perturbed. Compared to the non-magnetic case, or the kinematic phase of the dynamo when fields are too weak, we note that the frequencies and the strengths of the $f$-mode are enhanced in presence of saturated magnetic fields, with these effects being larger at larger wavenumbers. This qualitatively confirms the earlier findings from observational and numerical works which reported the $f$-mode strengthening due to strong sub-surface magnetic fields.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05529v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Exploring the central engines of gamma-ray bursts from prompt light curves</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05587</link><description>arXiv:2602.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05587v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The kinematic cosmic dipole beyond Ellis and Baldwin</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05700</link><description>arXiv:2602.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic dipole anomaly, currently detected at a significance exceeding 5$\sigma$ in several independent survey poses a significant challenge to the standard model of cosmology. The Ellis &amp; Baldwin formula provides a theoretical link between the intrinsic dipole anisotropy in the sky distribution of extragalactic light sources and the observer's velocity relative to the cosmic rest frame, under the assumptions that the sources follow a power-law luminosity function and exhibit power-law spectral energy distributions. In this work, we demonstrate that this relation can be generalized to arbitrary luminosity distributions and spectral profiles. We derive the corresponding expression for the effective spectral index and apply it to a sample of quasars observed in the W1 band of the CatWISE survey. We show that the anomalous cosmic dipole persists beyond the power-law assumption. These results provide a more general and robust framework to interpret measurements of the cosmic dipole in future large-scale surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05700v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Relativistic Dynamics and Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton Accretion onto Rotating Embedded Black Hole Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05747</link><description>arXiv:2602.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the motion of test particles and relativistic accretion mechanisms within the spacetime of a rotating and embedded BH. In this case, the geometric properties of the metric and their dynamical consequences for particle trajectories are systematically studied, with a specific focus on circular orbits together with their existence criteria and stability constraints. Also, the effective potential and the corresponding effective force are constructed to quantify the influence of rotation and embedding parameters on the attractive and repulsive sectors of the gravitational interaction. Closed-form expressions for orbital frequencies as measured by a distant observer are derived, enabling a quantitative analysis of relativistic precession phenomena, including periastron advance and Lense-Thirring precession. Furthermore, we conduct general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of BHL accretion onto rotating embedded BHs. In addition, within the framework of the BHL accretion mechanism, the numerical solution of the GRH equations shows that the embedding parameter \alpha systematically modifies the morphology of the shock cone formed around embedded BHs compared to the Kerr model. In particular, a wider opening angle of the cone is produced, the compression of matter in the post-shock region is weakened, and the dynamical variability of the flow is enhanced. The time-dependent mass accretion rate exhibits increasing oscillation amplitudes and long-term variations with increasing \alpha, while these amplitudes are found to be suppressed by the frame-dragging effect associated with the BH spin parameter. At the same time, increasing values of $\alpha$ lead to a strengthening of the QPO frequencies formed around embedded BHs in the LFQPO regime, enhancing their observability and increasing the likelihood of detecting commensurate frequency ratios such as 3:2.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05747v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Predicting galaxy bias using machine learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05881</link><description>arXiv:2602.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how galaxies trace the underlying matter density field is essential for characterizing the influence of the large-scale structure on galaxy formation, being therefore a key ingredient in observational cosmology. This connection, commonly described through the galaxy bias, $b$, can be studied effectively using machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer strong predictive capabilities and can capture non-linear relationships. We aim to incorporate the linear bias parameter assigned to individual galaxies into a ML framework, quantify its dependence on various halo and environmental properties, and evaluate whether different algorithms can accurately predict this parameter and reproduce the scatter in several bias relations. We use data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, including the distance to different cosmic-web structures computed with DisPerSE. These data are complemented with an object-by-object estimator of the large-scale linear bias ($b_i$), providing the individual contribution of each galaxy to the bias of the entire population. Our ML framework uses three models to predict $b_i$: a Random Forest Regressor, a Neural Network and a probabilistic method (Normalizing Flows). We recover the full hierarchy of galaxy bias dependencies, showing that the most informative features are the overdensities, particularly $\delta_8$, followed by the distances to cosmic-web structures and selected internal halo properties, most notably $z_{1/2}$. We also demonstrate that Normalizing Flows clearly outperform deterministic methods in predicting galaxy bias, including its joint distributions with galaxy properties, owing to their ability to capture the intrinsic variance associated with the stochastic nature of the matter-halo-galaxy connection. Our ML framework provides a foundation for future efforts to measure individual bias with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.05881v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] ACT DR6+Planck impact on inflation with non-zero vacuum expectation value and the post-inflationary behavior</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06027</link><description>arXiv:2602.06027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is studied for a model of cosmic inflation which predicts a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) $M$ for a large-field regime. Since lower values of $M$ are compatible with the higher spectral index $n_s$ provided by the ACT+Planck joint analysis, we establish new limits on this parameter while also considering further CMB data from the latest BICEP/Keck Array release for CMB polarization modes. We find $\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ at 68\% confidence level, compatible with $M/M_{Pl}\simeq 0.003$, which is interesting for post-inflationary processes, such as preheating. We conduct a lattice simulation for the inflaton field for the first few e-folds, as the model is compatible with the production of relics such as oscillons, which are possible candidates as sources of gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We find that the model indeed produces localized, quasi-spherical structures compatible with oscillons, which might lead to signatures detectable by future experiments. However, in agreement with recent works, we find that although the abundance of gravitational waves that could be generated in this regime has an amplitude well within the sensitivities of these detectors, the frequency range is on the GHz limit, away from the expected frequencies. Finally, we estimate the impact of a coupling of the type $y\phi\sigma^2$ to the inflaton, in the realization of perturbative reheating, directly impacting the predictions of the model, as lower values of $M$ are consistent with both the entire allowed temperature range, and the limits imposed by BICEP/Keck Array+Planck+ACT.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.06027v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Suppression of Gravitational-Wave Echoes in Diffeomorphism-Invariant Nonlocal Gravity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04996</link><description>arXiv:2602.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04996v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from DESI and CMB data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05108</link><description>arXiv:2512.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the spectrum of $n_s$ constraints from current CMB data (Planck, ACT, SPT-3G) combined with DESI BAO data, and highlight the interplay of $n_s$ with the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2\sigma$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $\alpha$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $\alpha$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $\tau$.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05108v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02484</link><description>arXiv:2602.02484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02484v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Importance of Shot Noise in the Search for an Isotropic Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background with Next Generation Detectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15014</link><description>arXiv:2509.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of shot noise on the stochastic gravitational wave background generated by binary neutron star mergers, and confirm that the overall background can be significantly influenced by relatively few neighboring, loud events. To mitigate the shot noise, we propose a procedure to remove nearby events by notching them out in the time-frequency domain. Additionally, we quantify the cosmic/sample variance of the resulting background after notching, and we study the deviation between the cross-correlation measurement and the theoretical prediction of the background. Taking both effects into account, we find that the resulting sensitivity loss in the search for an isotropic background formed by binary neutron star mergers is minimal, and is limited to $\lesssim 4\%$ below 40 Hz, and to $\lesssim 1\%$ above 40 Hz.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15014v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Spider-webb: Spatially Resolved Evidence of Inside-out Quenching in the Spiderweb Protocluster at z ∼ 2</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3003</link><description>We present a spatially resolved analysis of galaxy quenching within the Spiderweb Protocluster at z ∼ 2.16, combining deep imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Hubble Space Telescope. Utilizing pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution fitting, we derive maps of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and rest-frame UVJ colors. Quiescent galaxies, predominantly found at , exhibit clear mass-dependent inside-out quenching, with central sSFR approximately an order of magnitude lower than outer regions, while lower-mass star-forming galaxies show flat sSFR profiles. Central star formation activity fundamentally anticorrelates with Sérsic index, indicating reduced activity in bulge-dominated systems. Spatially resolved UVJ colors reveal heterogeneous internal star formation, distinguishing star-forming regions in quiescent hosts from those in globally star-forming systems. These findings demonstrate that quenching mechanisms were effectively operating by z ∼ 2, with the observed inside-out patterns and morphological correlations consistent with active galactic nuclei-driven feedback processes.

Our spectroscopic targets were selected from three photometric surveys: NGVS, DES, and Pan-STARRS 1. We derive center-of-mass radial velocities with uncertainties of 6–35 km s−1. The halo velocity dispersion measured with our sample is 70 ± 7 km s−1. The velocity field shows a possible dipole-like structure, with redshifted northern and blueshifted southern hemispheres. Fitting a MW–Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) dipole perturbation model yields a weak/marginal dipole signal, with an amplitude of km s−1 and an apex direction deg, along with a bulk compression velocity of −16 ± 11 km s−1. While limited by sky coverage and sample size, our results are consistent with the presence of LMC-induced disequilibrium in the distant halo beyond 100 kpc. Aside from the 55 RR Lyrae stars, our spectroscopic analysis reveals that 10 additional phometrically selected RR Lyrae candidates are, in fact, quasar/blazar contaminants; this provides a cautionary tale about the presence of such contaminants in sparsely sampled photometric surveys. Our study demonstrates that single-epoch spectroscopy of RR Lyrae stars is a viable method for probing the kinematics of the outer halo, and future surveys like Rubin/LSST and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI-II) have the potential to significantly advance this effort.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae313b</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Repeating versus Nonrepeating Fast Radio Bursts: A Deep Learning Approach to Morphological Characterization</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae323c</link><description>We present a deep learning approach to classify fast radio bursts (FRBs) based purely on morphology as encoded on recorded dynamic spectrum from Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)/FRB Catalog 2. We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability. ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as images) of the FRBs into one of the two subclasses, i.e., repeater and nonrepeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and the relation between the subpulse structures. Additionally, we also used a mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that the morphological differences between repeating and nonrepeating CHIME events persist in Catalog 2 and the deep-learning model leveraged these differences for classification. The fine-tuned deep-learning model can be used for inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB’s morphology resembles that of repeaters or nonrepeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly significant when trained on larger datasets that will exist in the near future.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae323c</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Dynamical Origins of Azimuthal Metallicity Variations in the Galactic Disk: Insights from Kinematic Ridges with Gaia</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae346c</link><description>Kinematic and spectroscopic studies in the past few years have revealed coherent azimuthal metallicity variations across the disk of the Milky Way (MW) that may be the result of dynamical process associated with nonaxisymmetric features of the Galaxy. At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridgelike features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia Data Release 3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the Vϕ–R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of MW test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius (Sgr)-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemokinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sgr-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations is too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and comoving groups.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae346c</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Pair Instability Supernova Origin of the High-[Fe/Mg] and High-[Si/Mg] Nature of the Quasar ULAS J1342+0928 at Redshift z = 7.54</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2f47</link><description>The discovery of ULAS J1342+0928, a metal-enriched quasar ([Fe/H]∼1) at redshift z = 7.54 with an extremely high iron-to-magnesium abundance ratio ([Fe/Mg]∼1), has sparked a new insight into the origin of heavy elements in the early Universe. An earlier study by Yoshii et al. has shown that standard chemical evolution models of the quasar host galaxy involving Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) and core-collapse supernovae cannot reproduce the high-[Fe/Mg] nature of the broad-line region (BLR) gas of this quasar. Rather, the [Fe/Mg] value estimated in their study would be the result of heavy-element enrichment from a Population III (Pop III) pair-instability supernova (PISN). To investigate their result, we have run a series of photoionization models of the BLR gas enriched by such a PISN and have developed a highly updated version of their original method to convert heavy-element emission-line intensities to their abundances in the BLR gas. Our analysis reveals, for the first time, that the observed equivalent widths of Mg II, Si IV, and Fe II emission lines in ULAS J1342+0928 indicate abundance trends of [Mg/H] = 0.10 ± 0.09 (random) ± 0.3 (systematic), [Si/Mg] = 0.93 ± 0.02 (random) ± 0.2 (systematic), and [Fe/Mg] = 0.87 ± 0.06 (random) ± 0.2 (systematic). Particularly, the values of [Si/Mg] and [Fe/Mg] are best explained by a Pop III PISN with a progenitor mass of 240–280 M⊙, in support of Yoshii et al.’s result. If future observations of ULAS J1342+0928 confirm the significant odd–even effect of [Al/Mg] ≲ −1, as predicted by nucleosynthesis calculations for Pop III PISN, this would provide unambiguous evidence for the existence of a Pop III PISN at z ≳ 7 and shed light on the first Pop III stars in the Universe.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2f47</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Magnetic Field Amplification and Particle Acceleration in Weakly Magnetized Transrelativistic Electron–Ion Shocks</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3723</link><description>We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel transrelativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel (filamentation) instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations (σ ≳ 10−3), whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations (σ ≲ 10−4). Shocks with precursors shaped by Bell modes efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction εi ∼ 0.2 of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as . A much smaller fraction εe ≪ 0.1 of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell regime. On the other hand, when the precursor is dominated by Weibel modes, the shock efficiently generates both nonthermal ions and electrons with εi ∼ εe ∼ 0.1, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, .

The anticipated experiment requires a sightline separation of 100 AU, achieved by sending three or more radio telescopes to the outer solar system. The Shapiro time delays, measured relatively between different telescopes, are sensitive to the gradient field of the gravitational potential between different sightlines. Since the arrival time difference is independent of when the transient signal is emitted from the source, every measurement of the detected FRB source can be correlated. With enough FRB sources discovered, we can map the gravitational potential across the sky. We further calculate the two-point and three-point correlation function of the arrival time difference between telescopes for different FRB sources in the sky. If 104 FRBs were to be detected, our results suggest that this technique can test the inflationary scale-invariant power spectrum down to ∼ 103 Mpc-1 and primordial Non-Gaussianities at a level of fNL ∼ 1.</description><author>Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/02/022</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Cosm] Enhancements in velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation in Galactic subhalos</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/02/024</link><description>We examine velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation in subhalos using a sample of six Milky Way-like galaxies from the Aurgia simulation suite. We quantify the enhancement in the annihilation rate in subhalos when including the contribution from particles in the smooth component of the halo that overlap with the subhalos. The enhancement in the annihilation rate scales with the smooth component of the host halo dark matter density, and is evident for subhalos over the resolvable mass range. Maximal enhancement factors are ∼ 48 for p-wave models, and ∼ 37,000 for d-wave models. For p and d-wave annihilation models, ∼ 13 and ∼ 6 subhalos, respectively, across all six host halos have emission from dark matter annihilation in their direction that is above the foreground emission from the smooth dark matter component, and would therefore be resolvable as sources. Such subhalos with the most significant enhancement factors tend to be on the lower end of the mass range and located closer to the center of the host galaxy. We provide a prescription to calculate the enhancement for subhalos as a function of distance from the Galactic center, and use this to examine the impact on dark matter limits from a couple of example dwarf spheroidals. We show that, including the enhancement factors, limits from individual dwarf spheroidals are at a cross section scale that may approach those derived from the Galactic center.</description><author>Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/02/024</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Importance of Heat Flux in Low-Mach-number, Quasi-parallel Collisionless Shocks</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2acc</link><description>Collisionless plasma shocks are a common feature of many space and astrophysical systems. They are sources of high-energy particles and nonthermal emission, channeling as much as 20% of the shock’s energy into nonthermal particles. The generation and acceleration of these nonthermal particles have been previously studied and shown to affect shock hydrodynamics to the zeroth order. In this work, we use self-consistent hybrid particle-in-cell simulations to examine the effect of self-generated nonthermal ion populations on the nature of collisionless, quasi-parallel shocks. Accelerated nonthermal particles downstream of the shock diffuse into the upstream region, taking energy away from the shock, which increases the compression ratio, slows the shock down, and flattens the nonthermal population’s spectral index for lower-Mach-number shocks. We show that this enhances shock compressibility when the heat flux is included in the Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions, results that are roughly consistent with previous theories of “cosmic-ray-modified shocks.” Additionally, the simulation data show that heat flux and enthalpy flux cancels out in the upstream region, yielding a relatively simple, alternative closure for the jump conditions which accurately predict for the shock speed and compression ratio. The results have the potential to explain discrepancies between predictions and observations in a wide range of systems, such as inaccuracies in predictions of the arrival times of coronal mass ejections and the conflicting radio and X-ray observations of intracluster shocks. These effects will likely need to be included in fluid modeling to predict shock evolution accurately.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 06 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2acc</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03928</link><description>arXiv:2602.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z &lt; 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $\Lambda$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}} &lt; 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03928v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Low-mass stars dominate the hot (0.7 keV) Galactic X-ray emission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03941</link><description>arXiv:2602.03941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way is composed of a tenuous atmosphere filled with multi-phase plasma, including a warm-hot virialised component. Recent studies suggest a much hotter (~0.7 keV) super-virial component detected in both absorption and emission. We want to shed light on the nature of this putative super-virial component. We analysed the X-ray background as observed by SRG/eROSITA over the entire western Galactic hemisphere. We show that low-mass stars provide a large fraction of the 0.7 keV emission. Indeed, a tight correlation is found between the surface brightness of the 0.7 keV emission and the mass distribution of the Milky Way across a large portion of the western Galactic hemisphere. The correlation coefficient implies an X-ray luminosity per unit of stellar mass comparable to that of the average low-mass stars within 10 pc of the Sun, suggesting that unresolved M dwarfs and F, G, and K type stars dominate the 0.7 keV emission. This emission is asymmetric with respect to the Galactic plane, influenced by the asymmetric distribution of nearby star-forming regions, and broadly consistent with the known offset of the Sun above the Galactic midplane. The remaining signal might be produced by the cumulative emission of stars of different types or ages, in addition to other sources (e.g. hot interstellar medium, Galactic corona, etc.). Assuming that the putative residual hot super-virial atmosphere is homogeneous and has a spherical beta profile with slope $\beta=0.4$, we constrain its density at 10 kpc to be $n_e&lt;4\times10^{-4}$~cm$^{-3}$. Our findings may help refine models of the circumgalactic medium around external galaxies, advancing our understanding of hot baryon flows and galaxy evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03941v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] On the coupled origin of the stellar IMF and multiplicity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03976</link><description>arXiv:2602.03976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the solar neighborhood, the Initial Mass Function (IMF) follows is canonically described by the Salpeter power-law slope for the high-mass range. The stellar IMF may directly result from a Core Mass Function (CMF) through accretion, gravitational collapse, and fragmentation. This inheritance implies that the mass of the gaseous fragments may be connected to the properties of clustered and multiple stellar systems. We aim to (i) quantify the influence of hierarchical fragmentation of cores on the resulting IMF, and (ii) determine the consequences of this fragmentation on the multiplicity of the stellar systems. We employed a scale-free, hierarchical fragmentation model to investigate the fragmentation of top-heavy CMF. Hierarchical fragmentation of gas clumps shifts the CMF towards lower mass range and can modify its shape. Starting from the top-heavy power-law CMF observed in W43-MM2&amp;amp;MM3 star forming region, we show that at least four levels of hierarchical fragmentation are required to generate the turn-over peak of the cIMF. Within a radius of 0.2-2.5 kAU, massive stars (M &gt; 10 Msun) have on average 0.9 companions, five times fewer than low-mass stars (M &lt; 0.1 Msun); the latter are less dynamically stable and should disperse. We show that a universal IMF can emerge from mass-dependent fragmentation processes provided that more massive cores produce less fragments compared to lower mass cores and transfer their mass less efficiently to their fragments. Hierarchical fragmentation alone cannot reconcile a universal IMF with observed stellar multiplicity. We propose that fragmentation is not scale-free but operates in two distinct regimes: a mass-dependent phase establishing the Salpeter slope and a mass-independent phase setting the turn-over. Our framework provides a way to compare core subfragmentation in various star-forming regions and numerical simulations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03976v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] $\gamma$-Ray Lines -- Signatures of Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Rays, Positron Annihilation, and Fundamental Physics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04592</link><description>arXiv:2602.04592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear $\gamma$-ray lines in the MeV range of the electromagnetic spectrum hold a vast variety of astrophysical, particle-physical, and fundamental physical information that is otherwise extreme difficult to access. MeV $\gamma$-ray line observations provide the most direct evidence for ongoing nucleosynthesis in galaxies by measuring freshly produced radioactive isotopes from massive stars, supernovae, classical novae, or binary neutron star mergers. Their flux ratios can determine the low-energy cosmic-ray spectrum in different objects and of the Milky Way as a whole. Different phases of the interstellar medium are traced by hot nucleosynthesis ejecta, cooling positrons, or cosmic-ray interactions with molecular clouds. Positron annihilation itself can be considered as an astrophysical messenger as their production and destruction in typical space environments is inevitable. Finally, as-of-yet unknown signatures from beyond standard model physics might have their elusive imprints in $\gamma$-ray lines. This Chapter gives an overview of historical $\gamma$-ray line measurements, newest results, and open questions that may only be solved by a new generation of MeV telescopes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.04592v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Ultralight time-oscillating scalars from magnetized compact stars: electrophilic radiation and photon propagation effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03953</link><description>arXiv:2602.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars with electrophilic couplings to the time-dependent Goldreich-Julian charge density of magnetized compact stars can be radiated from their magnetospheres, contributing to pulsar spin-down. Coupling to the time-independent component of the charge density instead generates a quadrupolar scalar field profile, which may influence the orbital dynamics of binary systems. Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03953v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Inference on inner galaxy structure via gravitational waves from supermassive binaries</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link><description>arXiv:2411.05906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar-timing arrays indicates the presence of a population of supermassive black hole binaries. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to substantial hardening during a transition from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. Here we model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile before scouring by binary ejections while accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analysing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic-centre density of around $10^6 M_{\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ is favoured across most of the parameter space, thus shedding light on the environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centres.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.05906v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] COSMOS-Web: Estimating Physical Parameters of Galaxies Using Self-Organizing Maps</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04138</link><description>arXiv:2506.04138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COSMOS-Web survey, with its unparalleled combination of multiband data, notably, near-infrared imaging from JWST's NIRCam (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W), provides a transformative dataset down to $\sim28$ mag (F444W) for studying galaxy evolution. In this work, we employ Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), an unsupervised machine learning method, to estimate key physical parameters of galaxies -- redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), and age -- directly from photometric data out to $z=3.5$. SOMs efficiently project high-dimensional galaxy color information onto 2D maps, showing how physical properties vary among galaxies with similar spectral energy distributions. We first validate our approach using mock galaxy catalogs from the HORIZON-AGN simulation, where the SOM accurately recovers the true parameters, demonstrating its robustness. Applying the method to COSMOS-Web observations, we find that the SOM delivers robust estimates despite the increased complexity of real galaxy populations. Performance metrics ($\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ typically between $0.1$--$0.3$, and Pearson correlation between $0.7$ and $0.9$) confirm the precision of the method, with $\sim$ $70\%$ of predictions within 1$\sigma$ dex of reference values. Although redshift estimation in COSMOS-Web remains challenging (median $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.04$), the overall success of the highlights its potential as a powerful and interpretable tool for galaxy parameter estimation. A key advance of this work is the use of JWST/NIRCam photometry, particularly the F444W band, which enhances SOM training and allows more accurate estimation of stellar mass, SFR, and age compared to previous studies using IRAC/Spitzer filters.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.04138v4</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08077</link><description>arXiv:2507.08077v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.08077v5</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Laboratory Modeling of Supernova Remnants Collisions: Implications for Triggered Star Formation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05151</link><description>arXiv:2508.05151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical models of star formation consistently underestimate the rates observed in astronomical surveys. Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation, and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14%-25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, in particular those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena, and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.05151v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The GUAPOS project.

Abstract: The study of the chemical composition of star-forming regions is key to understanding the chemical ingredients available during the formation of planetary systems. Because the chemical inventory of interstellar dust grains in prestellar phases might be altered by protostellar warming, an alternative to inferring the chemical composition of the grains might be to observe regions that are affected by shocks associated with molecular outflows. These shocks can desorb the molecules and might produce less chemical processing because the timescales are shorter. We present a detailed study of the chemical reservoir of a shocked region located in the G31.41+0.31 protocluster using data from the G31.41+0.31 Unbiased ALMA sPectral Observational Survey (GUAPOS). We report the detection of 30 molecular species (plus 18 isotopologs). We compared the molecular ratios in the shocked region with those derived toward the hot core of G31.41+0.31. They are poorly correlated, with the exception of N-bearing species. Our results confirm observationally that a different level of chemical alteration is present in hot cores and in shocks. While the former likely alter the molecular ratios by thermal processing during longer timescales, the latter might represent freshly desorbed material that constitutes a better proxy of the composition of the ice mantle. The similarity of the molecular ratios of the N-bearing species in the G31.41+0.31 shock and the hot core suggests that these species are predominantly formed at early evolutionary stages. Interestingly, the abundances in the G31.41+0.31 shock are better correlated with other shock-dominated regions (two protostellar outflows and a molecular cloud in the Galactic center). This suggests that gas-phase chemistry after shock-induced ejection from grains is negligible and that the composition of the ice mantle is similar regardless of the Galactic environment.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16094v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] QUIJOTE scientific results XIX.

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to estimate the spectral index, $\beta_s$, of polarised synchrotron emission, combining the moment expansion of CMB and the constrained-ILC. We reconstructed the maps of the first two synchrotron moments, combining multi-frequency data, and applied the `T-T plot' technique between two moment maps to estimate the synchrotron spectral index. This approach offers a new technique for mapping the foreground spectral parameters, complementing the model-based parametric component separation methods. Applying this technique, we derived a new constraint on the spectral index of polarised synchrotron emission using QUIJOTE MFI wide-survey 11 and 13 GHz data, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data at K and Ka bands, and Planck LFI 30 GHz data. In the Galactic plane and North Polar Spur regions, we obtained an inverse-variance-weighted mean synchrotron index of $\beta_s = -3.11$ with a standard deviation of $0.21$ due to intrinsic scatter, consistent with previous results based on parametric methods using the same dataset. We find that the inverse-variance-weighted mean spectral index, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties, is $\beta_s^{\rm plane} = -3.05 \pm 0.01$ in the Galactic plane and $\beta_s^{\rm high\text{-}lat} = -3.13 \pm 0.02$ at high latitudes, indicating a moderate steepening of the spectral index from low to high Galactic latitudes. Our analysis indicates that, within the current upper limit on the Anomalous Microwave Emission polarisation fraction, our results are not subject to any appreciable bias. Furthermore, we infer the spectral index over the entire QUIJOTE survey region, partitioning the sky into 21 patches. This technique can be further extended to constrain the synchrotron spectral curvature by reconstructing higher-order moments when better-quality data become available.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.17761v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12392</link><description>arXiv:2506.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ show effective independence from the model parameters due to degeneracies in the slow-roll parameters that leads to unresolved parameter degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.12392v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Brightest Gamma-Ray-burst Flare Observed in GRB 221009A: Bridging the Last Gap between the Prompt Emission and Flare in Gamma-Ray Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae33be</link><description>Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phases of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the soft-X-ray, optical, and radio bands—but rarely in the gamma-ray band. Despite its extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy Eiso = 1.82 × 1053 erg for GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, Epeak ∼ 300 keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in the soft-X-ray or optical bands but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV–MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, bridging the last gap between the prompt emission and flare.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae33be</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Continued Rapid Radio Brightening of the Tidal Disruption Event AT2018hyz</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae286d</link><description>We present ongoing radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2018hyz, which was first detected in the radio at 972 days after disruption, following multiple nondetections from earlier searches. The new observations presented here span ≈1370–2160 days and 0.88–240 GHz. We find that the light curves continue to rise at all frequencies during this time period, following a power law of about Fν ∝ t3 (compared to Fν ∝ t5.7 at 972–1400 days) and reaching a peak luminosity of L ≈ 1040 erg s−1, comparable to the luminosity of the relativistic TDE Sw 1644+57 on the same timescale. The multifrequency data indicate that the peak frequency does not significantly evolve over the 1030 days span of our observations, while the peak flux density increases by an order of magnitude. The observed behavior is consistent with two possible scenarios: (i) a delayed spherical outflow launched about 620 days postdisruption with a velocity of ≈0.3c and an energy of ∼1050 erg; or (ii) a highly off-axis (≈80°–90°) relativistic jet with a Lorentz factor of Γ ∼ 8 and EK ≈ 1052 erg. Continued radio observations to capture the light-curve peak, as well as very long baseline interferometry observations, could distinguish between these scenarios.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae286d</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Cosmic Star Formation History: Insights from Kilonova-associated Gamma-Ray Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2f45</link><description>The origin of the Universe and its material content remains one of the most fundamental questions in science. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), with their extreme luminosities and detectability at high redshifts, provide a unique window into the history of cosmic formation and chemical evolution. Consequently, the GRB formation rate (FR) has been employed to trace the star formation rate (SFR) across cosmic time. GRBs are conventionally classified into long and short categories (lGRBs and sGRBs) based on their T90 duration. sGRBs are widely employed as tracers of the delayed SFR, owing to their origin linked to the inspiral timescales of compact binary systems. However, some studies suggest that the detection of supernova-associated sGRBs may indicate potential contamination by core-collapse events. In this work, we move beyond the T90 classification and focus exclusively on GRBs with confirmed kilonova signatures, which provide unambiguous evidence of binary compact star mergers, to reassess their connection with the delayed SFR. Through analysis of a sample of kilonova-associated GRBs (KN/GRBs), we find that even within this robust subset, the KN/GRB FR displays a trend contrary to that of the delayed SFR at low redshifts (z &lt; 1). This result challenges the conventional theory by indicating that low-redshift KN/GRBs may not accurately trace the delayed SFR, independent of core-collapse contamination, while further validation with larger KN/GRB samples is essential to determine the reliability of compact binary mergers as probes of delayed SFR.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2f45</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near-horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae38bc</link><description>Recent multiwavelength observations of M87* revealed a high-energy γ-ray flare without a millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical study of potential millimeter flares in M87*, using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. The emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution. We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk and compare the characteristic timescale (τ) with recent Submillimeter Array observations, finding that simulated τ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. For BH spin a = +0.5, we identify a distinct flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters vary near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. Most βm modes remain stable, but the EB-correlation phase is sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon subrings, focusing on modes ns = (0, 1). The ns = 0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns = 1 exhibits distinct behavior, highlighting the potential of space very long baseline interferometry to isolate subring features. Magnetic reconnection near the disk plane triggers a flux eruption that injects magnetized plasma into the jet funnel, enhancing outflow speeds and temporarily disrupting jet collimation before gradual recollimation. These results suggest transient variability near flares encodes key information about BH spin and magnetic structure, offering new probes of active galactic nuclei.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae38bc</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Role of Plasma Lensing in Fast Radio Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3a7e</link><description>Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magnetoionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs) can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a ∼90° PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few ×10 rad m−2 between the multiple images. The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B—earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies—can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios. These results suggest that plasma lensing could account for multiple complex observational features of FRBs and may play a nonnegligible role in modulating their observable properties.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3a7e</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Milky Way Project: Bridging Intermediate- and High-mass Star Formation with the MIRION Catalog of Yellowballs</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae31f6</link><description>We describe the construction and use of the Mid-InfraRed Interstellar Objects and Nebulae (MIRION) catalog, which was compiled from 6176 objects identified as “yellowballs” (YBs) by participants in the Milky Way Project. The majority of YBs are compact photodissociation regions generated by intermediate- and high-mass young stellar objects that are embedded in star-forming clumps ranging in mass from 10 to 106M⊙ and luminosity from 10 to 104L⊙. The MIRION catalog increases the number of candidate intermediate-mass star-forming regions (SFRs) by nearly 2 orders of magnitude, providing an extensive database with which to explore the transition from isolated low-mass to clustered high-mass star formation. The catalog comprises five tables that include mid- and far-infrared photometry, velocities of source-associated molecular clouds, distances to these molecular clouds, physical properties of source-associated star-forming clumps, and source crossmatches with other catalogs. The structure of the catalog enables users to easily sort objects for further study based on distance or environmental properties. Our preliminary analysis extends our earlier findings that indicate a relationship between infrared (IR) colors and the physical properties and evolutionary stages of SFRs. Photometry will be periodically updated online to incorporate measurements from volunteers participating in a classroom activity known as the People Enabling Research: a Yellowball Survey of the Colors Of Protostellar Environments (or PERYSCOPE) project.

We present a spectroscopic study of low-mass pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars (M &lt; 1 M⊙) in the exceptionally metal-poor cluster Dolidze 25 (Z ≈ 0.2 Z⊙), using Very Large Telescope/MUSE observations to probe accretion processes and disk evolution in a subsolar environment. We identify 132 cluster members using a combination of Gaia astrometry and spectroscopic youth indicators, including lithium absorption and Balmer emission. The stellar parameters are derived using low-metallicity BT-Settl models yielding effective temperatures, extinctions, and luminosities enabling robust estimates of stellar masses and ages. Mass accretion rates ( ) derived from Hα emission span 10−10–10−8M⊙ yr−1 with a median value of 8 × 10−10M⊙ yr−1. These rates are comparable to those in solar-metallicity regions of a similar age, such as Lupus and Orion, indicating minimal metallicity dependence in accretion processes. Our analysis shows that using solar-metallicity templates to fit low-metallicity stars leads to systematic overestimations of Teff (by approximately 300 K) and AV (by around 0.5 mag), underscoring the importance of employing metallicity-matched models for reliable characterization in low-Z environments. We present flux-calibrated, extinction-corrected spectra of these metal-poor PMS stars as a valuable resource for future investigations of disk evolution in subsolar regimes.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae28cf</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] An Information-based Metric for Observing Strategy Optimization, Demonstrated in the Context of Photometric Redshifts for LSST</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad7d07</link><description>The observing strategy (OS) of an astronomical survey influences the degree to which its resulting data can be used to accomplish any science goal, necessitating upcoming programs, including those on the Rubin and Roman telescopes, to solicit metrics in order to optimally choose an OS balancing the costs and benefits to diverse science cases. The requirement that such metrics must be fast to compute often forces them to bake in analysis choices that may not hold for real data. Furthermore, such metrics do not typically share units, impairing objectivity in combining them in an ultimate decision. We propose a metric for OS optimization that is based on the potentially recoverable mutual information about a physical parameter of interest from a sample of data under the constraints of a realistic OS and present a tractable estimation of a variational lower bound of this mutual information implemented in a public code using conditional normalizing flows. We demonstrate the calculation and interpretation of our information-theoretic metric in the context of photometric redshifts, a data product essential to virtually all extragalactic science applications of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, using mock galaxy catalogs, showing how it can discriminate between observing strategies that preclude robust redshift constraints and those that preserve more redshift information, without specifying an estimator. As our versatile metric reduces the reliance on analysis choices and is interpretable between science goals, we recommend its use to assess the impact of OS in any science application in which photometry may be forward modeled. ✎</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 05 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad7d07</guid></item><item><title>[Recent articles] Planetary architectures under the influence of a stellar binary</title><link>https://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202557225</link><description>Authors: M.

Abstract: We examine non-singular bounce cosmology within the framework of a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term in both non-viscous and bulk-viscous cases. Using the scale factor ansatz $\alpha(t)=\left(\frac{\alpha}{\eta}+t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2 \eta}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $\chi_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours. Our findings suggest that bounce cosmologies could offer a physically reasonable and observationally acceptable alternative or pre-inflationary scenario, while highlighting the role that viscosity could play for a stable and smooth cosmological evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02608v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Rhythm of the ISM: Tracing the Timescales of Gas Evolution and Star Formation across Galactic Environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02657</link><description>arXiv:2602.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical origin of the star formation scaling relations between the gas depletion time, the star-forming gas mass fraction, and the gas surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, on kiloparsec scales, all of which are the key ingredients of the observed Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. To elucidate these trends, we employ an analytical framework that explicitly connects these kiloparsec-scale properties to the timescales governing the rapid, continuous ISM gas cycle on the scales of individual star-forming regions, including the formation, dispersal, and local depletion of star-forming gas. Using a suite of idealized disk galaxy simulations spanning a range of environments from dwarf and Milky Way-mass systems to a gas-rich starburst analog, we measure the timescales of the gas cycle and relate them to the dynamical and turbulent properties of the interstellar medium (ISM). We find that star-forming regions form on a timescale close to the vertical turbulent crossing time of the galactic disk, $\sim$3-30 Myr, which decreases at higher $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ due to the increase in turbulent velocities in the ISM and the decrease in the disk thickness. In contrast, the local star formation and dispersal of such gas are set by the local conditions. Specifically, the local depletion time, $\sim$200-2000 Myr, is decreasing at higher $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$, as star-forming gas becomes denser and more efficient in forming stars. The lifetime of such gas is very short, $\sim$0.4-1 Myr, and only weakly increases with $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$. Together, our results demonstrate how the star formation properties of galaxies on kiloparsec scales emerge directly from the interplay between the galaxy-scale dynamics, ISM turbulence, and the state of star-forming gas.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02657v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The approximate gravitational lensing multiple plane mass sheet degeneracy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02802</link><description>arXiv:2602.02802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing has to deal with many modeling degeneracies, the most notable being the Mass Sheet Degeneracy (MSD). We review the MSD when one needs to model more lens planes, each one with an internal mass sheet. We take into account the non-linear lens-lens coupling and line of sight effects, the latter treated as external mass sheets with associated shear. If second order shear terms on external and internal mass sheets can be neglected, we show that the MSD is always retained, and the mass sheets influence can be reabsorbed in the redefinition of angular diameter distances. In particular, internal and external mass sheets can be placed on the same footing. The version of the MSD discussed here does not require any particular relation between the internal mass sheets in the different planes. Even when including time delays from all sources, a residual degeneracy involving time delays, mass sheets and $ H_0 $ remains. We develop a framework which shows what can actually be constrained in multiple plane lens systems.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02802v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Unraveling the Brown Dwarf Desert: Four New Discoveries and a Unifying, Period-Coded Picture</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02836</link><description>arXiv:2602.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present four newly validated transiting brown dwarfs identified through TESS photometry and confirmed with high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained from the FEROS and PLATOSpec spectrographs. Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02836v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] FORGE'd in the Early Universe: The Effect of Protostellar Outflows on Pop III Accretion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02953</link><description>arXiv:2602.02953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological zoom-in radiation magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation, using FORGE'd in FIRE, that follows the formation, growth, and evolution of a single metal-free Pop. III (proto)star at redshift $z \sim 14$. The simulation captures a rotationally supported circumstellar disk and protostellar jets, both resolved down to $&lt;100$ au scales. We find the star grows to $\sim 27$ M$_{\odot}$ over $31,000$ years, with its final mass regulated by accretion and protostellar jets. Protostellar jets form because the magnetic mass-to-flux ratio lies within the regime that allows jet launching, and they are further enabled by a rotating circumstellar disk with sufficient gas-magnetic-field coupling, both present in this simulation. These jets regulate accretion onto the (proto)star and drive outflows that collide with infalling gas, slowing inflow at large radii due to the substantial momentum they carry. A circumstellar disk forms, extending out to $\sim 0.01$ pc, which remains gravitationally stable (Q $\gg 1$). The stability of the disk is maintained through both thermal support and turbulence. In this paper we focus on how jets play a critical role not only in shaping the final masses of Pop. III stars but also in directly influencing their surroundings by regulating accretion. These results will provide important insights into the initial mass function and feedback processes in the earliest star-forming regions of the Universe.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02953v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] How Distance Affects GRB Prompt Emission Measurements</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03032</link><description>arXiv:2602.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated how Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) prompt emission measurements are affected by increasing distance to the source. We selected a sample of 26 bright GRBs with measured redshifts $z&lt;1$ observed by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and simulated what BAT would have observed if the GRBs were at larger redshifts. We measured the durations of the simulated gamma-ray signals using a Bayesian block approach and calculated the enclosed fluences and peak fluxes. As expected, we found that almost all durations (fluences) measured for simulated high-$z$ GRBs were shorter (less) than their true durations (energies) due to low signal-to-noise ratio emission becoming completely dominated by background, i.e., the ``tip-of-the-iceberg'' effect. This effect strongly depends on the profile and intensity of the source light curve. Due to the uniqueness of GRB light curves, there is no common behavior in the evolution of measured durations with redshift. We compared our synthetic high-$z$ (i.e., $z&gt;3$) GRBs to a sample of 72 observed high-$z$ bursts and found that the two samples were not inconsistent with being drawn from the same underlying population. We conclude that: (i) prompt emission durations (fluences) of high-$z$ GRBs observed by Swift/BAT are most likely underestimations, sometimes by factors of $\sim$several tens ($\sim2$), and (ii) changes in the average GRB prompt emission duration and fluence with increasing redshift are consistent with the tip-of-the-iceberg effect.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03032v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The SAMI Galaxy Survey: Quenching of Star Formation in Clusters III.

Abstract: Cluster environments influence galaxy evolution by curtailing star formation activity, notably through ram-pressure stripping (RPS). In this study, using spatially resolved spectroscopic data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify galaxies undergoing or recently affected by RPS in eight nearby clusters ($0.029 &lt; z &lt; 0.058$), through a visual classification scheme based on the ionised gas ($\rm H\alpha + [NII]\lambda 6584$) morphologies, split into unperturbed, asymmetric, and truncated. The projected phase-space analysis shows that asymmetric galaxies are found in a narrow region in cluster-centric distance ($\rm 0.1 &lt; R/R_{200} &lt; 0.6$) and have a larger dispersion in line-of-sight velocity ($\sigma(|v_{pec}|)_\mathrm{Asym} = 0.71^{+0.09}_{-0.07}\ \sigma_{200}$) compared to the truncated and unperturbed samples. In terms of star formation activity, RPS candidates yield a much steeper resolved star-forming main sequence (rSFMS; $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR} - \Sigma_\ast$) relation compared to the unperturbed counterparts, primarily emerging from having lower $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ values for the low mass density regime, with the steepest gradient deriving from the truncated sample. Moreover, radial star formation profiles reveal that star formation in RPS candidates is suppressed in the outskirts relative to unperturbed galaxies and is more prominent for the truncated sample. In contrast, central ($\rm r/r_{eff}&lt;0.5$) star formation activity in RPS candidates is comparable with that in their unperturbed and field counterparts, suggesting no elevated activity. Taken together, this suggests an evolutionary trend linked to the RPS stage, where unperturbed galaxies likely represent recently accreted systems (pre-RPS), while asymmetric and truncated galaxies may correspond to populations undergoing RPS and post-RPS phases, respectively, favouring outside-in quenching.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03088v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Narrow absorption lines from intervening material in supernovae: III.

Abstract: Narrow interstellar absorption features in supernova (SN) spectra serve as valuable diagnostics for probing dust extinction and the presence of circumstellar or interstellar material. In this third paper in a series, we investigate how the strength of narrow interstellar absorption lines in low-resolution spectra varies with SN type and host galaxy properties, both on local and global scales. Using a dataset of over 10000 spectra from $\sim1800$ low-redshift SNe, we find that Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in passive galaxies exhibit significantly weaker narrow absorption features compared to CC-SNe and SNe Ia in star-forming hosts (SNe Ia-SF), suggesting lower interstellar gas content in quiescent environments. Within the star-forming hosts, the Na I D equivalent-width distribution of SNe II is much lower than that of both SNe Ia-SF and stripped-envelope SNe (SE-SNe). This result is somewhat unexpected, since CC-SNe are generally associated with star-forming regions and occur deeper within galactic disks, where stronger line-of-sight extinction would be anticipated. This suggests that the observed behaviour cannot be explained solely by absorption from the integrated interstellar medium (ISM) along the line of sight. Instead, if part of the absorption arises from material near the explosion, the similarity between the Na I D EW distributions of SNe Ia-SF and SE-SNe implies that comparable absorption signatures can emerge from distinct progenitor pathways. Possible explanations include (a) circumstellar material (CSM) expelled by the progenitor system before explosion, or (b) interaction of SN radiation with nearby patchy ISM clouds. Our results highlight the diagnostic power of interstellar absorption features in revealing the diverse environments and progenitor pathways of SNe.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03599v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] On the Influence of Pluto on Twotino Dynamics Through Their Mutual 4:3 Mean Motion Resonance</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03616</link><description>arXiv:2602.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The role of Pluto contributing to the long-term evolution of the trans-Neptunian region has been considered significant only over its neighboring Plutinos. However, it has recently been found that the long-term stability of the Twotino population is strongly affected when including Pluto as a massive object in simulations, while Eris, with a similar mass, has a negligible effect.
  Aims: We hypothesize that the effect of Pluto on Twotinos results from the latter being trapped in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (MMR) with Pluto. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the resonant behavior of Twotinos within Pluto's 4:3 MMR and the significance of this resonance for the long-term evolution of the population.
  Methods: We run high-resolution, 10 Myr REBOUND simulations of the observed Twotino population in the Kuiper belt, under the perturbations of the Sun, the four giant planets, and Pluto, as massive objects.
  Results: We find that all objects trapped in the 2:1 MMR with Neptune are locked in a weak 4:3 MMR with Pluto. The 4:3 resonant angles of most objects trapped in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 MMR, librate with amplitudes lower than $360^\circ$. Objects in the symmetric islands of the 2:1 MMR librate in the 4:3 MMR with amplitudes greater than $360^\circ$, but, contrary to circulating objects, will oscillate by up to $840^\circ$ visiting preferred angles on Pluto's co-rotating frame, indicating a diluted resonant effect that may also perturb their orbits on secular timescales.
  Conclusions: The importance of Pluto in shaping the structure of the trans-Neptunian region should be reconsidered, especially for resonant populations. Moreover, with current computational power, its exclusion from simulations can not be justified.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.03616v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] $\nu p$-process in Core-Collapse Supernovae: Imprints of General Relativistic Effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02055</link><description>arXiv:2508.02055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of a number of proton-rich isotopes in the solar system has been a long-standing puzzle. A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. While recent studies have analyzed several relevant physical effects that influence the efficiency of this process, the impact of General Relativity (GR) on it remains unexplored. We perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated $\nu p$-process yields in Newtonian and fully GR calculations, using detailed models of time-evolving outflow profiles. The GR effects are seen to suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the resulting $p$-nuclide abundances. Our reference GR model, with an 18~$M_\odot$ progenitor, reproduces both the relative and absolute solar system abundances of the entire set of the $p$ nuclides in the mass range $74\leq A\leq102$. The yields are suboptimal in our 12.75~$M_\odot$ GR model, where the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, suppressing further $p$-nuclide production. In both models, most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes occurs relatively early, 1--3 seconds after shock revival. In contrast, a large fraction of the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$ is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In summary, with the GR effects taken into account, the $\nu p$-process in a sufficiently massive progenitor can provide a unifying explanation for the origin of all $p$ nuclei in the solar system up to $^{102}$Pd.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.02055v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Connection between Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies and the First Massive Quenched Galaxies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26646</link><description>arXiv:2509.26646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-redshift (z &gt; 2) massive quiescent (MQ) galaxies provide an opportunity to probe the key physical processes driving the fuelling and quenching of star formation in the early Universe. Observational evidence suggests a possible evolutionary link between MQs and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; or submillimetre galaxies), another extreme high-redshift population. However, galaxy formation models have historically struggled to reproduce these populations - especially simultaneously - limiting our understanding of their formation and connection, particularly in light of recent JWST findings. In previous work, we presented a re-calibrated version of the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model that provides an improved match to observationally-inferred number densities of both DSFG and MQ populations. In this work, we use this new model to investigate the progenitors of MQs at z &gt; 2 and the physical mechanisms that lead to their quenching. We find that most MQs at z &gt; 2 were sub-millimetre-bright ($S_{870}$ &gt; 1 mJy) at some point in their cosmic past. The stellar mass of MQs is strongly correlated with the maximum submillimetre flux density attained over their history, and this relation appears to be independent of redshift. However, only a minority of high-redshift DSFGs evolve into MQs by z = 2. The key distinction between typical DSFGs and MQ progenitors lies in their merger histories: MQ progenitors experience an early major merger that triggers a brief, intense starburst and rapid black hole growth, depleting their cold gas reservoirs. In our model, AGN feedback subsequently prevents further gas cooling, resulting in quenching. In contrast, the broader DSFG population remains sub-millimetre-bright, with star formation proceeding primarily via secular processes, becoming quenched later.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.26646v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19443</link><description>arXiv:2510.19443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.19443v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Planet Migration in Protoplanetary Disks with Rims</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21328</link><description>arXiv:2511.21328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates. Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21328v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A Persistently Active Fast Radio Burst source Embedded in an Expanding Supernova Remnant</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05448</link><description>arXiv:2512.05448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain one of the most puzzling astrophysical phenomena. While most FRBs are detected only once or sporadically, we present the identification of FRB 20190520B as the first persistently active source over a continuous span of ~ four years. This rare long-term activity enabled a detailed investigation of its dispersion measure (DM) evolution. We also report that FRB 20190520B exhibits a substantial decrease in DM at a global rate of minus 12.4 plus or minus 0.3 pc cm^-3 yr^-1, exceeding previous FRB DM variation measurements by a factor of three and surpassing those observed in pulsars by orders of magnitude. The magnitude and consistency of the DM evolution, along with a high host DM contribution, strongly indicate that the source resides in a dense, expanding ionized medium, likely a young supernova remnant (SNR).</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.05448v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09742</link><description>arXiv:2510.09742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects includes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the so-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify--for the first time--the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be ~15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to ~50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.09742v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Low-energy Radio Bursts from Magnetar XTE J1810−197: Implications for Fast Radio Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae279f</link><description>Magnetars are the leading candidate sources of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, the observational probes of the connections between magnetars and FRBs are severely limited by the paucity of detection of highly energetic radio events from magnetars—to date, only one radio burst as energetic as FRBs has been detected from a Galactic magnetar. Here, we present a detailed analysis of a large sample of low-energy bursts detected from the magnetar XTE J1810−197, and probe their implications for FRB emission from magnetars. We report detection of over 97,000 bright radio pulses from 242 observations of the magnetar XTE J1810−197 over 4.5 yr and two decades in frequency (300 MHz–6.15 GHz), using the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope and the Green Bank Telescope, after its recent outburst onset in 2018 December. We present a detailed analysis of the burst fluence distributions and their trends with time as well as frequency, and the waiting time distribution. We show that XTE J1810−197 rapidly switches between pulsar-like and giant-pulse-like emission states, and magnetars like XTE J1810−197 remain viable and likely emitters of FRBs, in the form of giant pulses with energies comparable to FRBs. We also demonstrate that the lack of detection of an underlying periodicity in the bursts from repeating FRBs might be caused by emission across a wide range of spin phases.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae279f</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Galaxy Evolution in Compact Groups.

A subset—non-isolated CGs—are embedded within major structures. Using multiband S-PLUS data, we analyse galaxies in 122 non-isolated CGs within more-massive systems, such as larger groups and clusters. We compare them to galaxies in the host structures, hereafter surrounding group galaxies. Structural parameters were obtained with MorphoPLUS, a pipeline for multiwavelength Sérsic profile fitting. Dividing galaxies into early-type galaxies (ETGs), transition, or late-types (LTGs), we find the following: (1) Non-isolated CGs host higher quenched fractions and more ETGs, especially for stellar masses than surrounding groups. (2) Sérsic indices increase with wavelength for all morphological types in both environments, whereas effective radii show a stronger morphology-dependent behavior—ETGs become more compact towards redder bands, while LTGs exhibit flatter Re(λ) trends. Environmental differences remain weak, with only a modest enhancement of the gradients for ETGs in non-isolated CGs.

(4) Phase-space analysis indicates that some CGs in clusters are projection artifacts, while others are genuine dense systems at various infall stages, from recent arrivals to ancient remnants. These results show that galaxies in non-isolated CGs follow distinct evolutionary paths compared to their surrounding groups galaxies, suggesting that the compact configuration plays a unique role beyond the influence of the larger-scale environment.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2bdd</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] CHIME/FRB Discovery and Localization of the Swift-observed FRB 20241228A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ea0</link><description>On 2024 December 28, the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) FRB project detected the thus-far nonrepeating FRB 20241228A with a real-time signal-to-noise ratio of &gt;50. Approximately 112 s later, the X-ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory was on-source, the fastest follow-up to date of a nonrepeating fast radio burst (FRB). Using CHIME/FRB and two of the three CHIME/FRB Outriggers, we obtained a very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) localization for FRB 20241228A with a 1σ confidence ellipse of 11″ by 0 2. This represents the first published localization using both the CHIME k’niʔatn k’l⌣stk’masqt and CHIME Green Bank Observatory Outriggers. We associate FRB 20241228A with a star-forming galaxy at a redshift of z = 0.1614 ± 0.0002. The persistent X-ray luminosity limit at this source’s location and distance is &lt;1.2 × 1043 erg s−1 in the 0.3−10 keV band, the most stringent limit of any nonrepeating FRB to date. The stellar mass (∼2.6 × 1010M⊙) and star formation rate (∼2.9 M⊙ yr−1) of the host galaxy of FRB 20241228A are consistent with the broader FRB host-galaxy population. We measure significant scattering (∼1 ms at 600 MHz) and scintillation (∼15 kHz at 600 MHz) along the line of sight to this source, and suggest the scintillation screen is Galactic while the scattering screen is extragalactic. FRB 20241228A represents an exciting example of a new era in which we can harness VLBI localizations and rapid high-energy follow-up to probe FRB progenitors.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ea0</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Fast-cooling Synchrotron Prompt Emission from Internal Shocks in GRB 241030A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2eaf</link><description>We present a time-resolved joint Swift–Fermi spectral study of GRB 241030A (z = 1.411) that cleanly isolates the synchrotron origin of its prompt emission and favors a matter-dominated internal-shock scenario. The light curve shows two episodes separated by a quiescent gap. Episode 1 (0–45 s) is well described by a single power law with photon index ≃ –3/2, consistent with the fast-cooling synchrotron slope below the peak. Episode 2 (100–200 s) exhibits two robust spectral breaks: a low-energy break at Eb ∼ 2–3 keV that remains nearly constant in time, and a spectral peak Ep that tracks the flux within pulses but steps down between them. The photon indices below and above Eb cluster around −2/3 and −3/2, respectively, as expected for fast-cooling synchrotron emission. The burst displays an unusually small (consistent with zero) spectral lag across Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor bands. At later times (≳230 s), the spectrum softens toward ∼–2.7, as expected when the observing band lies above both νm and νc. These behaviors are difficult to reconcile with a globally magnetized outflow with a decaying field, which naturally produces hard-to-soft Ep evolution, growing νc, and appreciable lags. By contrast, internal shocks with a roughly steady effective magnetic field and a time-variable minimum electron Lorentz factor (equivalently, for example, a varying fraction of accelerated electrons) simultaneously account for: (1) the stable Eb; (2) the intensity-tracking yet stepped-down Ep; (3) the canonical −2/3 and −3/2 slopes; and (4) the near-zero lag.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2eaf</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Inferring the Intrinsic Energy Function of FRB 20220912A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2fb8</link><description>The statistical analysis of fast radio burst (FRB) samples from repeaters may suffer from a band-limited selection effect, which can bias the observed distribution. We investigated the impact of this selection bias on the energy function through simulations and then applied our analysis to the particular case of FRB 20220912A. Our simulations show that, in the sample of bursts observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope, assuming a unimodal intrinsic energy distribution, the band selection effect alone is insufficient to produce a bimodal energy distribution; only the bimodal central frequency distribution can achieve this. The bursts’ energy of FRB 20220912A that primarily fell within the observing band showed no significant correlation with the central frequency. In contrast, bursts with higher central frequency tend to exhibit narrower bandwidth and longer duration. The distribution of the intrinsic energy can be modeled as a lognormal distribution with a characteristic energy of 8.13 × 1037 erg, and a power-law function with the index of 1.011 ± 0.028. In contrast to the initial energy function reported by Y.-K. Zhang et al., the low-energy peak vanishes, and the high-energy decline becomes steeper, which implies the low-energy peak is an observational effect. The bimodality of the energy distribution seems to originate from the intrinsic radiation mechanism.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2fb8</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Probing Baryonic Feedback and Cosmology with the 3 × 2-point Statistic of Fast Radio Bursts and Galaxies</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ff9</link><description>The impact of galaxy formation processes on the matter power spectrum is uncertain. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), through their dispersion measures (DMs) encoding the integrated baryon density, offer a unique window into gas distribution. In this work, we investigate the constraining power of a 3 × 2-point correlation statistic of DMs and galaxies. We present the correlation formalism, derive covariance matrices, and forecast signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and Fisher constraints. Assuming a host DM variance of 90 pc cm−3, for 104 (105) FRBs across 35% of the sky, the angular DM power spectrum is noise dominated at multipoles ℓ ≳ 20 (100), implying that the analysis can be conducted using arcminute localizations. In practice, this will be limited by uncertain host associations, which are expected to impact the mean DM subtraction—and thus our assumed value of σhost = 90 pc cm−3—in DM perturbations. While 104 (105) FRBs can constrain cosmological parameters at the ∼40%–70% (30%–40%) level, this is a factor of ∼2–3 (1.5–2) weaker than the precision attainable with galaxy clustering alone due to shot noise from the FRB number density, variance of the field, and host DMs. On the contrary, feedback-sensitive scales are not currently accessible in galaxy surveys. We demonstrate that combining DM and galaxy correlations in a 3 × 2-point analysis breaks feedback–cosmology degeneracies, yielding ∼10%–18% (7%–13%) precision on cosmological parameters and ∼3% (2%) constraints on feedback using 104 (105) FRBs. For the range of accessible scales, the SNR does not vary significantly with feedback. This work positions the DM–galaxy 3 × 2 point statistic as a promising multiprobe strategy.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ff9</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Maximum Gravity Model for Partial Tidal Disruption Events: Mass Loss, Peak Fallback Rate, and Dependence on Stellar Properties</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae31e3</link><description>A star entering the tidal sphere of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can be partially stripped of mass, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (TDE). Here, we develop an analytical model for properties of these events, including the peak fallback rate, , the time at which the peak occurs, tpeak, and the amount of mass removed from the star, ΔM, for any star and any pericenter distance associated with the stellar orbit about the black hole. We compare the model predictions to 1276 hydrodynamical simulations of partial TDEs of main-sequence stars by a 106M⊙ SMBH. The model yields tpeak predictions that are in good agreement (to within tens of percent) with the numerical simulations for any stellar mass and age. The agreement for is weaker due to the influence of self-gravity on the debris stream dynamics, which remains dynamically important for partial TDEs; the agreement for is, however, to within a factor of ∼2–3 in the majority of cases considered, with larger differences for low-mass stars (M⋆ ≲ 0.5M⊙) on grazing orbits with small mass loss. We show that partial TDE light curves for disruptions caused by ∼106M⊙ SMBHs can span ∼20–100 days peak timescales, whereas grazing encounters of high-mass stars with high-mass SMBHs can yield longer peak timescales (t ≳ 1000 days), associated with some observed transients. Our model provides a significant step toward an analytical prescription for TDE light curves and luminosity functions.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae31e3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] No Sign of a Magnetar Remnant Following the Kilonova-producing Long GRB 211211A ∼1.7 yr Later</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3009</link><description>In addition to a gamma-ray burst (GRB), the merger of two neutron stars (NSs) may produce a temporarily or indefinitely stable NS remnant with a strong magnetic field (a “magnetar”). As this magnetar remnant spins down, it can deposit its rotational energy into the surrounding kilonova ejecta, producing synchrotron emission that peaks in the radio bands ∼months to years after the merger (“boosted kilonova”). The nearby (z = 0.0763) long-duration GRB 211211A, which has an apparent kilonova counterpart and likely NS merger progenitor, may have produced such a remnant. We observed the location of GRB 211211A at 6 GHz with the NSF’s Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) spanning ≈0.54–1.7 yr after the burst. We do not detect any radio emission, placing strong limits on the energy deposited into the ejecta by any remnant to ≲4.4 × 1052 erg. Due to the proximity of the event, we are also able to place limits on a kilonova afterglow that did not receive any additional energy deposition, though it is possible such emission will be suppressed until ∼4 yr after the burst, when the kilonova is expected to overtake the forward shock of the GRB. Future observations with the VLA and next-generation radio facilities will be able to further constrain the magnetar-boosted kilonova and kilonova-afterglow scenarios, as well as directly constrain models in the scenario that GRB 211211A was instead produced by a collapsar.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3009</guid></item><item><title>[Publications of] Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ae3986</link><description>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework—combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise—to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters, show that some of our clusters share similar features, such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, typically seen in non-repeating FRBs, raising the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</description><author>Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 04 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ae3986</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles] Bose-Einstein condensate dark matter with logarithmic nonlinearity</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/vm6d-nf7d</link><description>Author(s): Zahra Haghani and Tiberiu Harko&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dark matter is composed of massive bosons, a Bose-Einstein condensation process must have occurred during the cosmological evolution.

Abstract: Inferring the intrinsic population of compact binary mergers is complicated by detector selection biases and measurement uncertainties. Traditional parametric methods are limited by the need to presuppose functional forms, introducing model-dependent biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an inference framework powered by deep generative modeling. We develop a flexible, data-driven population model using a Correlated Compound-Mixture Density Network. This architecture integrates mixture models to handle multimodality, Gaussian copulas for parameter dependencies, and a library of flexible marginal distributions. The network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the population's hyperparameters using amortized variational inference with Normalizing Flows on catalogs of gravitational-wave events. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities in two distinct regimes. First, using simulated catalogs of supermassive black hole binary mergers for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we show that the method accurately recovers complex three-dimensional distributions and absolute merger rates from sparse datasets, effectively correcting for selection effects and measurement uncertainties. Second, we validate the framework on real observational data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog, successfully inferring the population of stellar-mass binary black holes using an injection-based selection effect correction. Our results confirm that the method is robust, scalable, and applicable across different detector sensitivities and source populations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00195v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A JWST NIRCam/MIRI view of the W51A high-mass star-forming region</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00229</link><description>arXiv:2602.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the W51A region, including the massive protoclusters W51-E and W51-IRS2, with JWST in 10 NIRCam and 5 MIRI filters. In this work, we highlight the most novel features apparent in these images and compare them with other multi-wavelength images. The broad view of the NIRCam/MIRI images of the W51A region shows that areas dominated by warm dust and ionized gas are distinct from those dominated by PAHs. The high angular resolution of the JWST images resolves dust filaments in high contrast, revealing geometrically converging features feeding W51-E and a cavity around W51-IRS2. This picture adds support to the hypothesis that feedback from W51-IRS2 is suppressing further gas infall onto the protocluster, while by contrast, gas is still accreting onto W51-E. Comparing the NIRCam and MIRI images to ALMA data, we find 24 sources detected by both JWST and ALMA, accounting for only $\sim10\%$ of the ALMA sources; the rest are too embedded or too cool to be detected by JWST. A knot of [Fe II] and H$_2$ emission north of W51-IRS2, previously detected in ground-based images, reveals peculiarly bright and compact peaks detected in all JWST bands. The knot is likely the most energetic example of a protostellar jet driven by a massive star impacting dense interstellar medium. The new images provide a complementary view to the previous long-wavelength perspective on this 4 x 8 pc area of one of the most active star-forming regions in our Galaxy, revealing new mysteries to be further explored.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00229v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Kinematics of HI Envelopes Associated with Molecular Clouds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00236</link><description>arXiv:2602.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of molecular clouds through the kinematics of their atomic hydrogen (HI) envelopes, using $^{12}\mathrm{CO}$ and 21-cm emission to trace the molecular and atomic gas, respectively. We measure the large-scale gradients, $\Omega$, in the velocity fields of 22 molecular clouds and their HI envelopes, then calculate their specific angular momenta, $j\propto \Omega R^2$. The molecular clouds have a median velocity gradient of $9.6\times 10^{-2}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ pc^{-1}}$, and a typical specific angular momentum of $2.7 \times 10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$. The HI envelopes have smaller velocity gradients than their respective molecular clouds, with an average of $\Omega_\mathrm{HI} = 0.03\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ pc^{-1}}$, and a median angular momentum of $j_\mathrm{HI} \approx 5.7 \times 10^{24}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$. For a majority of the systems, $j_\mathrm{HI} &gt; j_\mathrm{H_2}$, with an average of $j_\mathrm{HI}/j_\mathrm{H_2} = 4$. Their velocity gradient directions tend to be misaligned, indicating that angular momentum is not conserved during molecular cloud formation. Both populations exhibit a $j-R$ scaling consistent with that expected of supersonic turbulence: $j_\mathrm{H_2} \propto R^{1.67\pm 0.22}$, and $j_\mathrm{HI} \propto R^{1.71\pm 0.27}$. Combining our measurements with previous observations, we demonstrate a scaling of $j \propto R^{1.50\pm 0.02}$ in star-forming regions spanning 5 dex in size, $R\in (10^{-3},\ 10^2) \ \mathrm{pc}$. We construct a model of angular momentum transport during molecular cloud formation, and derive the angular momenta of the progenitors to the present-day systems. We calculate a typical angular momentum redistribution timescale of 13 Myr, comparable to the HI envelope free-fall times.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00236v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Fireballs' Whispers of Their Central Engine: Relativistic Filtering of Afterglow QPOs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00257</link><description>arXiv:2602.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) afterglows have been suggested as probes of the central engine. Such interpretations generally assume that the observed modulation frequency directly corresponds to an intrinsic oscillation frequency of the source. We show that this assumption is not generally valid and that interpreting such features without accounting for relativistic propagation may lead to misleading inferences about the engine nature. We show that relativistic propagation effects - most importantly integration over equal-arrival-time surfaces - act as a frequency-dependent filter that can significantly modify or suppress intrinsic variability. In the constant- $\Gamma$ case, the angular kernel acts as a stationary low-pass filter that suppresses high-frequency variability without altering its frequency, whereas Blandford-McKee deceleration renders the filter time-dependent and manifests observationally as an apparent frequency drift.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00257v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Dynamical Interactions and Habitability in the TOI-700 Multi-Planet System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00332</link><description>arXiv:2602.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a second earth sized planet (TOI-700e) interior to the habitable candidate TOI-700d has prompted further research into this system, as the additional planet makes the TOI-700 system a tightly packed multi-planet system with multiple planets in the habitable zone, like TRAPPIST-1. In this work, we use the planetary evolution code VPLanet to assess the potential habitability of TOI-700d and TOI-700e. We first examine their orbital dynamics to evaluate the influence of planet-planet interactions on the planet spin, obliquity, and eccentricity. We then investigate whether these interactions are sufficient to cause either TOI-700d or e to be perturbed out of a habitable state, and whether we expect either planet could retain surface oceans over Gyr timescales. Together, these analyses allow us to assess the long-term habitability prospects of both TOI-700d and TOI-700e. We find that multi-planet interactions in the TOI-700 system do not prevent either planet from potentially retaining habitable conditions; however, we find that TOI-700e is located very near the boundary of the tidally locked habitable zone (arXiv:1705.10362), suggesting further work is needed to determine whether it is truly habitable.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00332v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Influence of star cluster mass, age, and galaxy star formation rate on star cluster radii</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00445</link><description>arXiv:2602.00445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star clusters are key components of galaxies, and the relationship between cluster radius and mass encodes information about cluster formation and evolution. Theoretical models predict that age and specific star formation rate (sSFR) should influence cluster size through stellar mass loss and gas dynamics during formation. We hypothesized that if these theoretical predictions hold, multivariate models including age and sSFR should predict cluster radius better than models using mass alone. To test this, we used regression analysis on 5,105 star clusters from the LEGUS survey, comparing a full multivariate model against a mass-only baseline. We found that mass dominated the radius-mass relation: log(Mass) showed a strong correlation with radius (coefficient = 0.131 +/- 0.008, p &lt; 0.001), while log(sSFR) and log(Age) contributed negligibly (0.0002 +/- 0.015 and 0.038 +/- 0.006, respectively). Cross-validation revealed that the mass-only model generalized better (CV R^2 = 0.028 vs -0.017), with the negative value for the multivariate model indicating overfitting. Contrary to our hypothesis, adding age and sSFR did not improve predictive performance. The low R^2 (0.115) indicated that most variance in cluster radius remained unexplained by these variables, suggesting other factors may play important roles. Among the variables tested, our findings were consistent with virial equilibrium predictions, with mass serving as a more fundamental parameter than evolutionary age or galaxy star formation rate.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00445v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Gamma-Ray Bursts: Evidence for a Common Origin of X-ray Plateaus with Diverse Temporal Decay Index</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00662</link><description>arXiv:2602.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit a plateau in the early X-ray afterglow light curve, whose mechanism remains uncertain. While the post-plateau normal decay index ($\alpha_2$) is commonly used to constrain the afterglow dynamics, the shallow-decay slope of the plateau itself ($\alpha_1$) has received comparatively little attention. Recent observations, however, reveal substantial dispersion in $\alpha_1$, raising the question of whether GRBs with rising, flat and mildly decaying plateaus represent intrinsically distinct populations. To address this question, we collect a uniform sample of 185 $\textit{Swift}$ GRBs with a well-defined plateau and divide them into three groups based on $\alpha_1$. Using a non-parametric approach, we reconstruct their X-ray luminosity functions, redshift distributions and event rates. It is found that the three groups exhibit statistically consistent properties across all diagnostics, with no evidence for group-specific features. Monte Carlo perturbation tests further show that these results are insensitive to the adopted classification boundaries of $\alpha_1$. Our results indicate that variations in the plateau slope $\alpha_1$ do not define distinct GRB subclasses, but instead the sample constitutes a statistically uniform population governed by a common framework.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00662v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A study of solar energetic particle transport on 30 March 2022 using multi-spacecraft data assimilation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00765</link><description>arXiv:2602.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a unique solar energetic particle event observed simultaneously by the BepiColombo and STEREO-A spacecraft on March 30, 2022. The two spacecraft at heliocentric distances of 0.6 and 1.0 AU are expected to be aligned approximately along the same magnetic field line, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate particle transport processes in the inner heliosphere. Protons with energies above 1.0 MeV exhibit velocity dispersion during the rise phase, suggesting that the energetic particles are produced close to the Sun, possibly associated with a coronal mass ejection. In contrast, protons during the decay phase are characterized by long-lasting time profiles with longer time scales at 1.0 AU than at 0.6 AU, suggesting that the particles deviate from ballistic propagation. By assimilating these multi-spacecraft observation data into numerical simulations of the focused transport equation, for the first time, we estimate the mean free path parallel to the magnetic field as a time series. The inferred mean free path decreases over time and approaches around 0.5-1.0 AU at the STEREO-A location during the decay phase, suggesting an increasing influence of scattering on particle transport. This interpretation is qualitatively supported by independent STEREO-A observations that showed increasing magnetic field fluctuations, suggesting the connection between the particle transport and the local field fluctuations. However, only a fraction of these fluctuations is expected to contribute to particle scattering, which may be due to the multidimensional nature of magnetic field fluctuations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.00765v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Successive Partial Disruptions with Orbital Precession in a White Dwarf-Black Hole System for Repeating GRB 250702B</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01073</link><description>arXiv:2602.01073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peculiar gamma-ray burst GRB 250702B is the longest event ever observed, lasting about one day and exhibiting four prompt-emission flares of $\sim100$ s with irregular recurrence intervals of at least one hour. To explain this hierarchy of timescales, we consider a scenario in which a stellar object undergoes repeated partial tidal disruptions by a black hole (BH). We find that if a white dwarf (WD) is on a highly eccentric orbit ($e\approx0.97$) around an intermediate-mass black hole (BH) with $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{6}\,M_\odot$ and $a = 50\,R_\odot\left(M_{\rm BH}/10^{6}\,M_\odot\right)^{1/3}$, the observed properties of GRB 250702B can be naturally reproduced. In this framework, the duration of each flare is determined by the viscous accretion timescale of material stripped near pericenter, with a typical mass $\Delta M \approx 2\times10^{-2}\,M_\odot$. The minimum recurrence time corresponds to the orbital period, while the total activity period is set by the secular orbital evolution timescale leading to the complete disruption of the WD. Furthermore, if $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{5}\,M_\odot$ and the orbit has a minimum polar angle relative to the BH equatorial plane of $\theta_{\rm min}\gtrsim0.12 {\rm rad}$, relativistic frame dragging induces $\gtrsim0.1$ rad precession of the orbital angular momentum between successive pericenter passages, comparable to a typical GRB jet half-opening angle, resulting in intermittent alignment with the observer and irregular flare spacing. The WD experiences $\approx40$ jet-launch episodes before complete disruption, but only four are expected to be observed on-axis. The remaining off-axis jets become visible at late times, enhancing the radio afterglow by about an order of magnitude, providing a testable prediction of this scenario.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01073v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Radiation-Driven Origin of Super-Equipartition Magnetic Fields in Accretion Discs and Outflows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01097</link><description>arXiv:2602.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a central role in accretion physics around black holes, yet their physical origin within accretion flows remains an open problem. In this work, we investigate the generation and subsequent evolution of magnetic fields triggered by anisotropic radiation fields in black hole accretion discs with compact rotating inner corona. We self-consistently evolve the magnetic field using the generalized field evolution MHD equation, including advection, shear-driven induction, and Hall effects. The radiation field acts as a primary field generator, while azimuthal rotation in the magnetized plasma provides rapid amplification. We find that radiation-generated fields efficiently reach a dominant toroidal component by Keplerian rotation, leading to magnetic field strengths of order $\sim 10^{8}\,\mathrm{G}$ in the vicinity of a 10 solar mass black hole and accretion disc-corona emitting at luminosity equivalent to the Eddington unit. These magnetic fields are achieved within viscous timescales and reach or exceed local equipartition estimates based on gas pressure. When vertical outflows are included, the amplified magnetic fields are advected into the corona, magnetizing disc-launched winds and jet precursors with field strengths of similar order. Our results demonstrate that radiation is not merely a passive component of accretion flows, but provides a robust and unavoidable trigger for the generation of dynamically significant magnetic fields. Our results provide a physically grounded explanation for the origin of large-scale, structured magnetic fields in and around accretion discs. This mechanism offers a pathway for magnetizing accretion discs and their outflows without invoking externally supplied magnetic flux, with broad implications for X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei and other transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01097v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Galactic disc warps from $z = 2.5$ to modern epoch: ruling out observational effects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01286</link><description>arXiv:2602.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of galaxies show warps in their discs, usually noticeable at its periphery. The exact origin of this phenomenon is not fully established, although multiple warp formation mechanisms are proposed. In this study, we create a sample of more than 1000 distant ($z \lesssim 2.5$) edge-on galaxies imaged by HST and JWST. For these galaxies, we measurd characteristics of warps and finally analyse how their parameters and frequency change with time. We focus on our main result that galaxies with strong warps were more prevalent in the past compared to the modern epoch. We check how selection effects and varying image quality between objects in our sample could influence our results and conclude that varying fraction of warped galaxies is not caused by observational effects, but represents a genuine evolution. Such a trend may be consistent with mergers and interactions between galaxies being the primary mechanism of warp formation, as number density of galaxies decreases with time, implying higher rate of mergers and interactions in the past.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01286v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Photometric Redshift PDFs via Neural Network Classification for DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and Pan-STARRS</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01548</link><description>arXiv:2602.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a neural network classification (NNC) method for photometric redshift estimation that produces well-calibrated redshift probability density functions (PDFs). The method discretizes the redshift space into ordered bins and optimizes the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), which respects the ordinal nature of redshift and naturally provides uncertainty quantification. Unlike traditional regression approaches that output single point estimates, our method can capture multi-modal posterior distributions arising from color-redshift degeneracies. We apply this method to the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10 (LSDR10) and Pan-STARRS Data Release 2 (PS1DR2), using an unprecedented spectroscopic training sample from DESI DR1 and SDSS DR19. Our method achieves $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.0153$ and $\eta = 0.50\%$ on LSDR10, and $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}} = 0.0222$ and $\eta = 0.34\%$ on PS1DR2 combined with unWISE infrared photometry. The NNC method outperforms Random Forest, XGBoost, and standard neural network regression. We demonstrate that DESI DR1 significantly improves photo-$z$ performance at $z &gt; 1$, while the combination of deep optical photometry and mid-infrared coverage is essential for achieving high precision across the full redshift range. We provide a unified photometric redshift catalog combining LSDR10 and PS1DR2 with a hierarchical model selection strategy based on available photometry. The well-calibrated PDFs produced by our method are valuable for cosmological studies and can be extended to next-generation surveys such as CSST, Euclid, and LSST.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01548v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Achondrites in meteor data: Spectra, dynamics, and physical properties of candidate aubrite and eucrite impactors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01887</link><description>arXiv:2602.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meteor spectroscopy presents new opportunities for investigating the diversity of small Solar System bodies and capturing the real distribution of present material types. We analyze 180 higher-resolution meteor spectra from the All-sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) network to identify meteoroids with atypical compositions. In addition to several iron bodies, we identify the first two achondritic meteoroids in our database, both likely meteorite-dropping impactors, and compare them with a reference ordinary chondrite meteoroid observed under similar conditions. Their spectra show strong compositional departures: one case has strong Mg and Si with low Fe, while the other has strong Ca, Al and Ti with low Mg. Derived relative elemental abundances imply an aubrite-like and a eucrite-like composition. The aubrite-like meteoroid exhibits unexpected enhancements in Ca, Mn and Ti in short-lived intensity spikes, which we interpret as rapid release of localized inclusions rather than bulk enrichment. This indicates that transient spectral features can reveal internal heterogeneity in achondritic meteoroids beyond their average composition. Dynamical and physical properties are consistent with these classifications: the eucrite-like meteoroid originated from an inner-main-belt orbit influenced by the $\nu_6$ resonance and shows compact ablation with low erosion and an estimated bulk density of 3.16 $\pm$ 0.10 g cm -3; the aubrite-like meteoroid came from a short-period, low-eccentricity orbit similar to some E-type near-Earth asteroids. Both events show atypical light curves, but our results indicate that robust identification of achondritic meteoroids in surveys generally requires emission spectra. This work presents one of the first detailed studies of achondrites from meteor observations and provides reference properties of atypical meteors for future surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.01887v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A parametric model for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks with photoevaporative winds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02011</link><description>arXiv:2602.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks in massive star-forming regions may be exposed to ultraviolet radiation fields orders of magnitude stronger than the interstellar background. This intense radiation drives photoevaporative winds that fundamentally shape disk evolution and chemistry. However, full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of these systems remain computationally expensive, preventing systematic exploration of the parameter space. We present a parametric framework for efficiently generating density structures of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks with photoevaporative winds. Our approach implements a spherically diverging wind configuration with smooth transitions between the disk interior, the FUV-heated surface layer, and the wind itself. We validate this framework extensively against the FRIED grid of hydrodynamical simulations, demonstrating accurate reproduction of density structures across stellar masses from 0.3 to 3.0 M_sun, disk radii from 20 to 150 au, and external FUV fields from 100 to 100,000 G0. The complete framework is available as 'PUFFIN', a Python package that generates full 1D or 2D density structures in seconds to minutes, compared to weeks or months for equivalent hydrodynamical calculations. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this approach by modelling CO chemistry across a comprehensive parameter grid, using our density structures as inputs to thermochemical calculations. Our results show that external FUV irradiation significantly enhances CO gas-phase abundances through indirect heating mechanisms, which raise midplane temperatures and enhance thermal desorption of CO ice. This effect is strongest in the outer disk and scales with both external field strength and disk mass, with important implications for volatile budgets available to forming planets in clustered environments.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02011v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Astro-COLIBRI: An Innovative Platform for Real-Time Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02058</link><description>arXiv:2602.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of transient phenomena, such as supernovae, novae, Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and stellar flares, together with the emergence of new cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and Gravitational Waves (GWs), has revolutionized astrophysics in recent years. To fully exploit the scientific potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, researchers need a tool capable of rapidly compiling and contextualizing essential information for every new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.
  Astro-COLIBRI is a comprehensive platform that combines a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly interfaces including a website and mobile app for iOS and Android. It ingests alerts from multiple sources in real time, applies user-defined filters, and situates each event within its multi-messenger and multi-wavelength context. The platform provides clear data visualization, concise summaries of key event properties, and evaluations of observing conditions across a wide network of observatories worldwide. We here detail the architecture of Astro-COLIBRI, from the data pipelines that manage real-time alert ingestion and processing to the design of the RESTful API, which enables seamless integration with other astronomical software and services.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02058v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections in Different Data-Driven Solar Wind Conditions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02300</link><description>arXiv:2602.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical models of the solar wind and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) utilize photospheric magnetic field observations to prescribe the inner boundary conditions for the plasma solutions. These magnetic field data are available to the community through various observational instruments, prepared via different methodologies and/or flux-transport models. The solar wind solution driven by these maps provides the ambient plasma environment into which CMEs travel, coupling, and interacting with the surrounding plasma and governing the CME evolution and propagation in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. In this work, we use different input magnetic field maps for the same time period to drive the global Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM). We obtain the ambient solar wind conditions and compare the plasma properties and magnetic morphology in the coronal domain to study the influence of the input maps. To understand how the resulting coronal solutions impact CMEs, we launch eruptions described by analytical flux ropes into these data-driven solutions and compare their evolution in the coronal domain (up to 24 solar radii radially). The CMEs achieve varying speeds, deceleration rates, propagation directions, mass and energies while coupling with the background solar wind. We quantify these differences to show that the different input driving maps can significantly impact the simulated CME propagation in the solar wind plasma. This also highlights the importance of understanding the uncertainties associated with data-driven modeling that become increasingly important in operational models and space weather prediction.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02300v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Multi-Messenger Modeling of Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02367</link><description>arXiv:2602.02367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), a subclass of the most powerful transients in the Universe, remain promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, despite strong IceCube constraints on typical long GRBs. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to study a sample of seven LL~GRBs with their multi-wavelength observations to investigate leptohadronic processes during their prompt emission phases. The relative energy densities in magnetic fields, non-thermal electrons, and protons are constrained, with the latter defining the cosmic-ray (CR) loading factor. Our results suggest that LL~GRBs exhibit diverse emission processes, as confirmed by a machine-learning analysis of the fitted parameters. Across the seven LL~GRBs, we find the posterior medians of the CR loading factor in the range of $\xi_p \sim 0.2$--$1.6$. GRB~060218 and GRB~100316D, the lowest-luminosity bursts ($L_{\gamma, \rm iso} \sim 10^{46}$-$10^{47}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) consistent with the shock-breakout (SBO) scenario, yield the highest CR loading factor and therefore are expected to produce neutrinos more efficiently. Our model predicts the expected number of neutrino signals that are consistent with current limits but would be detectable with next-generation neutrino observatories. These results strengthen the case for LL~GRBs as promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and motivate real-time searches for coincident LL~GRB and neutrino events. Next-generation X-ray and MeV facilities will be critical for identifying more LL~GRBs and strengthening their role in multi-messenger astrophysics.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02367v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A Unified Framework for 10 TeV to EeV Diffuse Neutrino Sky and KM3-230213A</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02372</link><description>arXiv:2602.02372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing a unified origin that simultaneously accounts for the wide-band diffuse flux and recent ultra-high-energy (UHE) detections is a pressing challenge in multi-messenger astrophysics. Successive shock regimes in shock-breakout candidates, most notably low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), naturally introduce distinct physical environments producing a multi-component neutrino flux extending from 10 TeV to the UHE regime. Integrating prompt and afterglow phases within a unified dynamical framework yields a self-consistent explanation for this broadband emission. In this work, we discuss this framework, building on MWL observations. We show that the prompt emission from GRB~060218-like events accounts for $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the diffuse flux at 100~TeV, while GRB~100316D-like configurations predict a distinct flux peak near $10^{-9}\rm~GeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}~sr^{-1}$ at 100~PeV, providing a physical interpretation for the 220 PeV KM3-230213A event. This decoupling explains the lack of low-energy counterparts for individual UHE detections while maintaining consistency with the total diffuse neutrino flux. Ultimately, this framework identifies SBO-like LL~GRBs as a unifying origin for these phenomena, providing a physical link across a wide band from 10 TeV to EeV energies testable by next-generation observatories, including GRAND, IceCube-Gen2, and RNO-G.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02372v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Nonlinear interaction between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, mean flows and internal gravity waves in stellar stably-stratified layers: From 3D to 1D</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02421</link><description>arXiv:2602.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields have been constrained at the surface of several massive and intermediate-mass stars, but their origin and properties in deep stellar radiative interiors are still debated, despite recent detections in the core of some red giant stars. Therefore, the modelling of AM transport in stellar radiative layers only relies on theoretical and numerical estimates of magnetic fields. Recent 3D numerical simulations show that a dynamo could occur in deep radiative regions. A realistic setup for understanding AM transport in such layers thus requires to take into account the mutual interactions of IGW and dynamo-generated magnetic field. We model the dynamics induced by IGW and dynamo in rotating radiative stellar layers using a simple description applicable to various evolutionary stages. As dynamo action and the propagation of IGW are 3D processes that have characteristic timescales short compared to periods associated with structural evolution of stars, we propose a mean-field 1D model by taking advantage of the dynamo coefficients computed from 3D spherical simulations. In this model, the necessary mean shear flow to trigger the dynamo results from the dissipation of monochromatic IGW generated in existing adjacent convective layers, which are expected to drive the formation of an oscillating rotational shear layer, the so-called Shear Layer Oscillation (SLO). In turn, magnetic effects can act on the mean flow through the Lorentz force. We show that the inclusion of magnetic fields adds up to the already very complex nonlinear problem and gives rise to the emergence of new dynamical regimes. Particularly, the fast SLO generated very close to the place where IGW are generated is perturbed by magnetic fields. This dynamical change can filter the wave energy spectrum transmitted towards further layers, with potential influence on the long-term evolution of the inner rotation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02421v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Depth Calibration of Double-sided Strip Germanium Detectors for the Compton Spectrometer and Imager Satellite</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02442</link><description>arXiv:2602.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-sided strip high-purity germanium detectors with three-dimensional position reconstruction capability have been developed over three decades, with space-based applications in high-energy astrophysics and heliophysics. Position resolution in three dimensions is key to reconstruction of Compton scattering events, including for the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) satellite mission. Two-dimensional position reconstruction is enabled by segmentation of the two detector faces into orthogonal strip contacts, enabling a pixelized analysis. The depth of an interaction cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from the charge collection time difference between the two faces of the detector. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the depth calibration of a detector with the COSI satellite geometry read out using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed for the COSI mission. In this work, we map collection time difference to depth using the Julia-based simulation package SolidStateDetectors.jl and validate it with comparison to the timing distributions observed in data. We also use simulations and data to demonstrate the depth resolution on a per-pixel basis, with &gt;90% of pixels having &lt;0.9 mm (FWHM) resolution at 59.5 keV and &lt;0.6 mm (FWHM) resolution at 122.1 keV.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02442v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] X-ray characterization of fully-depleted p-channel Skipper-CCDs for the DarkNESS mission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02461</link><description>arXiv:2602.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark matter Nanosatellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors (DarkNESS) mission is a 6U CubeSat designed to search for X-ray lines from decaying dark matter using Skipper-CCDs. Thick, fully-depleted p-channel Skipper-CCDs provide low readout noise and high quantum efficiency for 1-10 keV X-rays, but their X-ray performance has not yet been demonstrated in the space environment. DarkNESS will operate in low-Earth orbit, where trapped protons induce displacement damage in the sensor that increases charge-transfer inefficiency and degrades the X-ray energy resolution. This work measures the X-ray line response of Skipper-CCDs before and after proton irradiation and quantifies the associated degradation. A sensor was exposed to 217 MeV protons at a fluence of 8.4 x 10^10 protons cm^-2, corresponding to a displacement-damage dose more than an order of magnitude above the three-year expectation for representative mid-inclination and Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbits. A 55Fe source was used to compare the energy resolution of the beam-exposed quadrant to adjacent unexposed quadrants and a non-irradiated reference sensor. These measurements provide a quantitative assessment of radiation-induced spectral degradation in Skipper-CCDs and enable an estimate of the end-of-life X-ray energy resolution expected for DarkNESS operation in low-Earth orbit.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02461v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The FLAMINGO Project: Exploring the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation as a probe of large-scale structure</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02484</link><description>arXiv:2602.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryonic feedback processes associated with galaxy formation directly influence the large-scale structure by redistributing gas. Recent measurements of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect and stacks of X-ray emission from optically selected galaxy clusters suggest that feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is more efficient at expelling gas from low-mass clusters than previously thought. The measurement of the cross-correlation between cosmic shear and diffuse X-ray emission provides a new probe of the distribution of gas in groups and clusters. We use the FLAMINGO cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations to examine the X-ray--cosmic-shear cross-correlation. The cross-correlation is most sensitive to the distribution of gas in haloes with masses $10^{14}\leq M_{200\mathrm{c}}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq10^{15}$. It is sensitive to the strength of feedback, but the effects of variations in cosmology and baryonic physics are largely degenerate. We compare the FLAMINGO predictions with the cross-correlation between cosmic shear from the Dark Energy Survey and ROSAT all-sky X-ray maps. We find that, if we neglect the X-ray emission from AGN that would remain unresolved by ROSAT, then the fiducial FLAMINGO model is in excellent agreement with the data, while models with stronger or weaker feedback are ruled out. However, if we account for unresolved AGN, either using the direct FLAMINGO predictions or by abundance matching to the observed (extrapolated) AGN luminosity function, then models with stronger feedback are preferred. We conclude that to exploit the potential of the X-ray--lensing cross-correlation, it will be necessary to resolve fainter AGN, and to use external constraints to break the degeneracy between baryonic feedback and cosmology.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2602.02484v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Mirage Sources and Large TeV Halo-Pulsar Offsets: Exploring the Parameter Space</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02829</link><description>arXiv:2407.02829v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric propagation of 100 TeV electrons (whose radiation mainly concentrates on 20--30 TeV) in turbulent magnetic fields around pulsars, using GPU-accelerated simulations to explore their trajectories and interactions within pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium. Key results include the identification of ``mirage'' sources indicating significant offsets in high-energy emissions from their originating pulsars, challenging the results of traditional symmetric diffusion models. By varying parameters like source distance, magnetic field strength, and electron injection spectral index, the study delineates their effects on observable phenomena such as the probability that a source has at least one mirage around it, as well as the source separation. Our results offer insights into some puzzling sources observed recently by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), and shed light on the cosmic-ray transport mechanism in the interstellar medium.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2407.02829v4</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14182</link><description>arXiv:2506.14182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a physically motivated dark-energy (DE) model rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE arises from the difference between the vacuum energy of an expanding FRW universe and Minkowski spacetime, induced by QCD topological sectors. The resulting DE term in the Friedmann equation scales with the Hubble rate, $\rho_{\rm DE}(t)\propto H(t)$, once DE dominates cosmic expansion, i.e. when the Universe is close to the de Sitter regime with $H\approx$ constant. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\sim100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally fixes the DE density and explains why its influence becomes significant only recently. The construction relies solely on the Standard Model of particle physics, introducing no new fields or couplings. The most fundamental change is the possibility of modifying the evolution of the background cosmology in the Friedmann equation. Key predictions include: (a) A present-day equation of state parameter $w_{\rm DE,0}&gt;-1$ that asymptotically approaches the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE}=-1$ in the future. (b) A present-day Hubble constant $H_0$ that asymptotically approaches a constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) For $z\ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}(z)$ may lie above or below $-1$ and can cross this boundary multiple times at different $z$, behavior qualitatively consistent with the recent DESI findings. (c) In our framework, any deviation from $\Lambda$CDM leads to a corresponding deviation of $H(z)$, which can be tested with existing and future cosmological observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.14182v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Chromatic activity window of periodic fast radio bursts: FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04609</link><description>arXiv:2507.04609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two fast radio bursts, FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B, show periodic activity with cycles of 159.3 and 16.33 days, respectively. These cycles consist of active and inactive windows, with the peak activity centred within the active phase. For FRB 20180916B, studies reported a frequency-dependent or chromatic behaviour, for which the activity window starts earlier and becomes narrower at higher frequencies. The activity across frequencies is typically modelled with a power law. We developed a simple model that combines the phase and frequency dependence of the activity windows of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B. Our goal was to perform a chromaticity study for FRB 20121102A that incorporates model improvements to account for the cyclic nature of its activity window and to compare the chromatic behaviour of the two periodic FRBs. We standardised the detections from the 425 observing epochs for FRB 20121102A and the 214 epochs for FRB20180916B to account for differences in the radio telescope sensitivity. To the normalised detection-rate phase distribution, we fitted a von Mises distribution and extracted the peak activity phase and activity width. These quantities as a function of frequency were then modelled as power laws to construct the chromatic model. The activity window starts earlier at higher frequencies for the two sources. The activity window of FRB 20121102A broadens at higher frequencies, however, and that of FRB 20180916B broadens at lower frequencies. Interestingly, it appears to remain active during at least 80% of the cycle at C band. The observed chromatic behaviour of FRB 20180916B is consistent with previous findings. For FRB 20121102A, a chromaticity in its activity window is also seen, but the source appears to be active for longer at higher frequencies, which is different from the behaviour of FRB 20180916B.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.04609v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18752</link><description>arXiv:2510.18752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56. Sky-localization thresholds of DeltaOmega &lt; 50 deg^2, or even DeltaOmega &lt; 10 deg^2, entail only mild penalties, suggesting efficient follow-up strategies. These results establish third-generation GW+EM observations, especially when combined with Roman supernovae, as a cornerstone for precision cosmology in the next decade.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18752v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Modeling Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei Using Hydrodynamic Simulations and Machine Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01811</link><description>arXiv:2511.01811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A nuclear star cluster like that of the Milky Way harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and influence the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of ``hit-and-run'' collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\gtrsim 0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.01811v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Planet Migration in Protoplanetary Disks with Rims</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21328</link><description>arXiv:2511.21328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates. Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21328v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Deuterium fractionation and CO depletion in Barnard 5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10143</link><description>arXiv:2512.10143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 (B5) region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30~m observations of N$_2$H$^+$(1--0), N$_2$D$^+$(1--0), H$^{13}$CO$^+$(1--0), and DCO$^+$(2--1), complemented by C$^{18}$O(2--1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps. We find that the deuterium fraction in both mentioned nitrogen- and carbon-bearing species increases from the protostellar to the starless core, reaching $R_D^{\rm N_2H^+}=0.43\pm0.10$ and $R_D^{\rm HCO^+}=0.09\pm0.02$ in the starless core, compared with $0.15\pm0.03$ and $0.05\pm0.01$, respectively, in the protostellar core. The CO depletion factor also rises from $4.1\pm0.1$ to $5.0\pm0.1$ across the same transition. While the embedded YSO reduces deuteration in the dense inner gas, the less dense envelope traced by HCO$^+$ is only slightly affected at our resolution. Our analysis confirms that CO freeze-out and the presence of a protostar jointly regulate deuterium chemistry in star-forming regions.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.10143v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Revisiting a Quasar Microlensing Event Towards AGN~J1249+3449</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18262</link><description>arXiv:2601.18262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.}</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18262v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Krylov Complexity in early universe</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link><description>arXiv:2411.18405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a framework for constructing wave functions in closed and open quantum systems from their Hamiltonians. Since the early universe is inherently an open system, we employ this algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across various cosmological phases: inflation, radiation domination (RD), and matter domination (MD). Our results highlight a clear distinction in Krylov complexity between the closed- and open-system methodologies. To accurately capture the influence of potentials during RD and MD, we examine a set of inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, $R^2$ inflation, and chaotic inflation, while incorporating violations of slow-roll conditions. This study is conducted in conformal time through the preheating stage. Numerically, we find that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy shows remarkable similarity across different potentials during RD and MD. Furthermore, we rigorously construct an open two-mode squeezed state using the second kind of Meixner polynomial. Based on this construction, we derive for the first time the evolution equations for the squeezing parameter $r_k$ and phase $\phi_k$ in terms of the scale factor. Our analysis indicates that dissipative effects lead to rapid decoherence-like behavior. In addition, we observe that the inflationary universe behaves as a strongly dissipative system, whereas during the RD and MD epochs the universe exhibits weak dissipative characteristics. This work opens new perspectives for studying the universe from a quantum-informational viewpoint.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.18405v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02331</link><description>arXiv:2506.02331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model. Using an open quantum system formalism from our previous work, we calculate the influence functional to fourth order, from which we then derive the inflaton four-point correlation function. When we decompose this function using isotropic basis functions, the expansion coefficients $\zeta_{\ell',\ell'',\ell'''}$ naturally split into parity-even and parity-odd components. In the large $\xi$ approximation, which enhances the production of right-handed photons in the model, the derivation of these coefficients simplifies. We work out the lowest-order nonvanishing parity-odd $\zeta_{234}$ term which clearly indicates the presence of parity violation. Moreover, our derived values of the coefficients are consistent with recent observational data from galaxy surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02331v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01060</link><description>arXiv:2510.01060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest-resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets performed on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers of $10^3 \le S \le 5 \times 10^5$ , reaching up to $65,536^2$ grid cells. We demonstrate a Sweet--Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values of Lundquist number, between $2\times 10^4\le S \le 2 \times 10^5$, plasmoid formation sets in, leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity-dependent and therefore slow. In this range of $S$-values, the plasmoids do not undergo a merger cascade, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Only for $S &gt; 2 \times 10^5$, we observe the nonlinear development of the tearing-mode instability, with plasmoid coalescence and a saturation of the reconnection rate at $V_\text{rec} / V_A \sim 0.01$. At such high $S$, however, the corresponding Reynolds number is large, reaching $\text{Re} &gt; 2000$ even on scales comparable to the current-sheet thickness. We therefore conclude that, in astrophysical systems, it is essential to account for the dominant influence of turbulence and three-dimensional effects in the reconnection process.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01060v3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Death by Impact: Evidence for Merger-driven Quenching in a Collisional Ring Galaxy at Cosmic Noon</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae23d0</link><description>The role of interactions and mergers in the rapid quenching of massive galaxies in the early Universe remains uncertain, largely due to the difficulty of directly linking mergers to quenching. Collisional ring galaxies provide a unique opportunity, as their morphology allows precise dating of the interaction, which can then be compared to quenching timescales inferred from star formation histories. We study a gravitationally bound system at z = 1.61 in the Ultra Deep Survey field, composed of a host galaxy (M⋆ = 1011.4M⊙) with a collisional ring and an X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN), and the Bullet Galaxy (M⋆ = 1011.2M⊙), located at a projected distance of ∼8 kpc. Combining JWST and Hubble Space Telescope imaging with Keck/MOSFIRE spectroscopy, we find compelling evidence for an ongoing starburst in the host concurrent with rapid quenching in the Bullet Galaxy. The ring, ∼20 kpc in diameter, is expanding at km s−1, implying the galaxies first collided 47–96 Myr ago. This timeline is consistent with the host’s current starburst and the Bullet Galaxy’s sudden quenching, strongly suggesting both phenomena were triggered by the interaction. Crucially, the Bullet Galaxy shows no evidence of a preceding starburst, ruling out rapid gas consumption as the primary quenching channel. Instead, we suggest that merger-driven processes—such as enhanced turbulence and disk instabilities—may have suppressed star formation. An additional possibility, which we term the dragon effect, is that AGN-driven outflows from the host disrupted the Bullet Galaxy’s low-density molecular gas, thereby preventing efficient star formation and accelerating quenching.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae23d0</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Ignition of Weak Interactions and r-process Outflows in Supercollapsar Accretion Disks</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2856</link><description>The collapse of rotating massive (∼10M⊙) stars resulting in hyperaccreting black holes (BHs; “collapsars”) is a leading model for the central engines of long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and a promising source of rapid neutron-capture (r-process) elements. R-process nucleosynthesis in disk outflows requires the accretion flow to neutronize. This occurs because of Pauli blocking at finite electron degeneracy, associated with a critical accretion rate . We analytically examine the assumptions underlying this “ignition threshold” and its possible breakdown with increasing BH mass M•. Employing three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations with weak interactions, we explore the physical conditions of collapsar accretion disks with M• ∼ 80−3000M⊙ over more than a viscous timescale as they transition through the threshold. There is remarkable agreement between our simulations and the analytic result for M• ∼ 3−3000M⊙. Simulations and analytic analyses consistently show that the largest BHs leading to r-process nucleosynthesis at are ≈3000M⊙, beyond which neutronization ceases, since the disk temperature decreases below the neutron–proton mass difference (≃MeV), suppressing the conversion of protons into neutrons. We show that stellar models of ∼250−105M⊙ can give rise to BHs of M• ∼ 30−1000M⊙ accreting at , yielding potentially up to ∼10−100M⊙ of light and heavy r-process elements per event. These rare but prolific r-process sources in low-metallicity environments are associated with super-kilonovae and likely extremely energetic GRBs. Such signatures may be used to probe Population III stars.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2856</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] No Evidence for Second-scale Periodicity in FRB 20201124A from 2021 April to June FAST Observations</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29a5</link><description>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright and short radio flashes of cosmological origin.

We search for such periodicity in the bursts of FRB 20201124A, observed by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope between 2021 April and June.

We select a 330-galaxy sample from IllustrisTNG50 (TNG50) matched to 33 FEASTS galaxies by stellar and H i masses, and mock observe them at the FAST resolution and depth at corresponding inclinations and distances for a fair comparison. In contrast to FEASTS, abnormally irregular and extended morphology is found in more than one-third of TNG50 galaxies, especially those that are massive and H i poor. Stellar feedback is the property that most significantly correlates with the H i morphological deviation from observations, although these deviations mostly occur at a high stellar or black-hole mass. These results indicate that, in TNG50, stellar feedback significantly influences the H i morphology at ∼1018 cm−2, while active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback has not so direct a role as expected. With an additional sample from Auriga, we find that the magnetic field may help H i to be more regular in its morphology, while improving the mass resolution does not alleviate the discrepancy from observation.

Stars form within giant molecular clouds, which fragment into dense clumps under the combined influences of turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation, and gravity. While some of these clumps collapse spontaneously, others require an external trigger, a mechanism estimated to account for 14%–25% of star formation in regions such as the Elephant Trunk Nebula. Laboratory astrophysics has emerged as a powerful approach for investigating such triggering processes, in particular those involving supernova remnants (SNRs). Recent experiments, guided by well-established scaling laws, have successfully replicated the dynamics of SNRs and their interactions with dense clumps or other SNRs. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of these experimental configurations using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics code TROLL. The simulations provide enhanced insight into the underlying physical mechanisms, accurately reproduce key experimental phenomena, and offer valuable comparisons with analytical models. This study underscores the strong synergy between laboratory experiments and numerical simulations, laying a robust foundation for future advancements in laboratory astrophysics. Furthermore, we propose a new experimental setup that offers improved scaling for the asymmetric collision observed in the DEM L316 system. Our findings also show that SNR collisions in dense environments can decrease the gravitational stability of dense clumps, thereby promoting their collapse and potentially triggering star formation.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2acf</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] CORINOS.

We present new measurements of SO2 ice from 6.8–8.5 μm toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST’s Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 L⊙ (B335, IRAS 15398–3359) to 10 L⊙ (L483, Ser-emb 7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 μm CH4 band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO2 feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO2 laboratory ices were tested: pure SO2 ice yields 0.3%–1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO2 ice (lower and upper limits); CH3OH:SO2 ice gives 0.02%–0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H2O:SO2 ice yields 0.2%–0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO2 ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO2 in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398–3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO2 ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence the role of SO2 as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding “missing sulfur” problem.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c81</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Particle Transport from First Principles in the Early Heliosphere: κ 1 Ceti as a Case Study for the Young Sun</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae313e</link><description>Several studies of Galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) modulation within the astrospheres of stars deemed to be proxies for the young Sun have concluded that the intensities of these particles would, at early stages of the Sun’s evolution, be negligible at 1 au. These studies, however, do not take into account the varying interstellar conditions the young Sun would have encountered as it traversed its Galactic orbit, nor do they realistically model the transport of GCRs. The present study, for the first time, examines the influence of various interstellar parameters in the Galactic spiral arms on the astrosphere of κ1 Ceti, a young Sun proxy, through magnetohydrodynamic modelling. We demonstrate that these conditions lead to an astrosphere with considerably smaller dimensions than previous estimates. We also model the transport of turbulence parameters within said astrosphere for the first time, demonstrating that turbulence levels could be significantly higher than observed in the heliosphere. Finally, these insights are implemented in a 3D, ab initio GCR transport model to compute GCR intensities at 1 au, demonstrating the importance of drift effects in astrospheric modulation: full drift effects lead to GCR intensities comparable to modern observations, while turbulence-reduced drift coefficients lead to significantly smaller intensities.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae313e</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Hierarchical Test of Lorentz Invariance with Gamma-Ray Burst Spectral-lag Measurements</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3374</link><description>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most potent probes of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), offering direct constraints on the quantum gravity energy scale (EQG) based on observations of energy-dependent time lags. Individual GRBs with well-defined positive-to-negative lag transitions have been used to set lower limits on EQG, but they suffer from uncertainties of spectral-lag measurements and systematics due to theoretical modeling of each burst. Here, we combine observations of 32 GRBs with positive-to-negative lag transitions to derive a statistically robust constraint on EQG through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We find that the dominant systematic uncertainty in LIV constraints arises from the intrinsic lag modeling. Accounting for this uncertainty with cubic spline interpolation, we derive robust limits of EQG,1 ≥ 4.37 × 1016 GeV for linear LIV and EQG,2 ≥ 3.02 × 108 GeV for quadratic LIV. We find that the probability for LIV, i.e., EQG,1 being below the Planck scale, is estimated to be around 90%, which we conclude as no significant evidence for LIV signatures in current GRB spectral lag observations. Our hierarchical approach provides a rigorous statistical framework for future LIV searches and can be extended to incorporate multimessenger observations.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3374</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Particle Acceleration and Depolarization in the Protostellar Jet Knots HH 80 and HH 81</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae355d</link><description>Linearly polarized emission is a powerful tracer of magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration in protostellar jets.

We place a 3σ upper limit of 30 μJy on the polarization intensity, corresponding to fractional polarization limits of and 0.01 for HH 80 and HH 81, respectively. To interpret this nondetection, we assess the conditions for synchrotron polarization and the impact of depolarization mechanisms. The shock cooling parameter χs is lower in these outermost HH objects than in the inner knots, indicating that the reverse shocks in HH 80–81 are less efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons compared with the inner knots. Moreover, Faraday depolarization appears severe: the dispersion in the estimated rotation measure (RM) σRM ∼ 400 rad m−2 is comparable to or larger than observed RM values themselves. This is consistent with strong fluctuations and turbulence. Together with beam depolarization, these effects can suppress the observable fractional polarization flux densities below the detectable thresholds. We conclude that reduced acceleration efficiency (when compared to inner knots) and strong depolarization account for the absence of polarized emission towards HH 80 and HH 81.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae355d</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Cosm] Four-point correlation functions in axion inflation</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/02/005</link><description>We study parity violation in the early universe by examining the four-point correlation function within the axion inflation model.

By contrast, simulations of this process in rotating spherical shells, which are typically driven by conductive boundary heat fluxes, generally yield results that depend on the diffusivity. This makes it challenging to extrapolate these simulation results to real objects. However, laboratory models and Cartesian-box simulations suggest that diffusion-free dynamics are more readily obtained if convection is driven using prescribed internal heating and cooling instead of boundary fluxes. Here, we apply this methodology to simulations of Boussinesq, hydrodynamic rotating spherical shell convection. We find that this setup unambiguously yields diffusion-free behavior for some bulk properties of the convection, such as the radial temperature contrast and the convective heat transport. Moreover, the transition from prograde to retrograde equatorial zonal flow is diffusion free and only depends on the convective Rossby number. The diffusivity dependence of other bulk properties is regime dependent. In simulations that are rotationally constrained, the convective velocities and the strength and structure of the zonal flow are diffusion dependent, although the zonal flow appears to approach a diffusion-free state for sufficiently high supercriticality. In simulations that are either uninfluenced by rotation or influenced by rotation only at large scales, diffusion-free convective velocities and zonal flows are obtained. The result that many aspects of our idealized simulations are diffusion free has promising implications for the development of realistic stellar and giant planet convection models that can access diffusion-free regimes.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ea8</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Daily briefing: What people with no ‘mind’s eye’ can tell us about consciousness</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00361-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 03 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00361-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00361-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;How clearly you can picture mental images might influence your memory and creativity.

Abstract: The orientation of radio jets relative to their host galaxies offers an interesting avenue for probing the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their surroundings. Several studies have also investigated the orientation of nuclear dust features. We follow up on this previous work with newer Hubble Space Telescope imaging of early-type radio galaxies, and a largely automated process for measuring position angles. We classify the dust features as lanes, disks, or rings. Lanes are irregular structures that likely form from gas-rich minor mergers, while disks and rings are more well-defined and may form from settling lanes or internal mechanisms. We find that dust lanes do not have a preferred alignment relative to their host galaxies, but are preferentially perpendicular to the jets. In contrast, dust disks and rings tend to be closely aligned with the major axes of their host galaxies, but have varying orientations relative to the jets. Our results suggest that infalling dusty material from mergers can influence the angle of the radio jet. This would allow the jet orientation to change over time, and may help explain the role of AGN feedback in maintaining quiescence in massive galaxies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22217v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Insights into the Physical Nature of Polar Ring Galaxies from H I Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22222</link><description>arXiv:2601.22222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar ring galaxies (PRGs) host an outer ring of gas and stars oriented nearly perpendicular to the main stellar body. They represent extreme examples of misaligned systems and provide valuable insight into galaxy interactions, gas accretion, and peculiar gas dynamics. We compile a complete sample of kinematically confirmed PRGs and collect their H I measurements. Combining literature data with new observations from FAST, we detect H I emission in 22 sources, identify one potential H I absorption feature, and find four non-detections among 40 confirmed PRGs. Compared to galaxies in the ALFALFA and xGASS surveys, PRGs predominantly occupy the green valley or quenched regimes but exhibit higher gas fractions than typical early-type galaxies, suggesting gas accretion. The H I profile asymmetry and shape for PRGs are not consistent with that of the ALFALFA sample with p&lt;0.05. We examine their Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) and baryonic TFR (bTFR), linking the systems' rotation velocities to their masses. The extreme outliers in TFRs for the control sample tend to display single-peaked H I profiles. PRGs do not follow a tight TFR or bTFR if the H I resides primarily in the host galaxy. But the scatter decreases significantly if we assume the gas is mainly distributed in the polar ring. Spatially resolved H I observations are essential to disentangle the gas distribution and kinematics in PRGs, which are key to understanding their formation mechanisms.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22222v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Obscured AGN at z &lt; 1.5: X-ray to Far-Infrared SEDs and Host Galaxy Morphologies in the GOODS Fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22227</link><description>arXiv:2601.22227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), galaxy light profiles, and visual morphological classifications for 194 X-ray luminous AGN (intrinsic absorption-corrected log10 LX(0.5 to 7 keV) less than 42.5, with a maximum of 45.2 ergs per second) at redshift z less than 1.5 in the GOODS fields. We generate X-ray to far-infrared SEDs normalized at 1 micron for all AGN and sort them according to their emission slopes in the ultraviolet and infrared. We visually classify their host galaxy morphologies and compute their bulge-to-total light ratios using the software Galaxy Shapes of Light (galight). Most (94 percent) GOODS AGN exhibit obscured SEDs, defined by diminished ultraviolet and/or mid-infrared emission, while only 6 percent show unobscured, quasar-like SEDs. Secular processes appear to play a large role in stimulating AGN emission, as only around one-third of galaxies are undergoing interactions. We also describe the morphological identification of a population of suspected post-merger spheroid galaxies with obscured ultraviolet and infrared SEDs, and distinguish them from the host galaxies of AGN with less obscuration in the ultraviolet or infrared.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22227v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Editorial: Mass and Angular Momentum Transport of Rapidly Rotating Hot Stars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22281</link><description>arXiv:2601.22281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dedicated journal collection will present and discuss a variety of science cases that can be used to extend our knowledge of massive stars and the influence of their rapid rotation on their subsequent evolution. The aim is to build understanding of this pivotal class of stellar objects that provides the energy and processed material driving galactic evolution and setting the stage for subsequent star and planet formation. This collection of papers offers a unique discussion of physical factors that are driven by rapid rotation and whose influence directly impact the evolution and end-of-life state of massive stars. They are presented together to give the reader a perspective that only the ensemble can provide instead of a single paper. We hope that we are successful in our goal of shedding light on the scope and outcome of this important facet of massive star physics.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22281v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The size-velocity dispersion relationship of Galactic HII regions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22656</link><description>arXiv:2601.22656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The size-velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) relation, while well established for giant HII regions, remains uncertain for their smaller counterparts (physical radii R &lt; 20 pc). Thanks to the LAMOST MRS-N dataset's large sky coverage and high spatial/spectral resolution, we examined this relationship using 10 isolated Galactic HII regions with R &lt; 20 pc. Our results reveal two key findings: (1) these small-size HII regions remarkably follow the same size-$\sigma$ relation as giant HII regions, suggesting this correlation could serve as a novel distance indicator for Galactic HII regions; and (2) we find distinct dynamical behaviors between younger and older HII regions. Specifically, in younger (&lt; 0.5 Myr), ionization-bounded HII regions, the velocity dispersion shows no correlation with expansion velocity, indicating that turbulence is driven primarily by stellar winds and ionization processes. In contrast, in older (&gt; 0.5 Myr), matter-bounded HII regions, a clear correlation emerges, implying that expansion-driven processes begin to play a significant role in generating turbulence. We therefore propose an evolutionary transition in the primary turbulence mechanisms, from being dominated by stellar winds and radiation to being increasingly influenced by expansion-driven dynamics, during the evolution of HII regions. Considering the small sample size used in this work, particularly the inclusion of only two young HII regions, which also have large uncertainties in their expansion velocities, further confirmation of this interpretation will require higher-resolution 2D spectroscopy to resolve blended kinematic components along the line of sight for more accurate estimation of expansion velocities, along with an expanded sample that specifically includes more young HII regions.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22656v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] On the dynamics of magnetoviscous warped discs around compact objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22683</link><description>arXiv:2601.22683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion discs that are tilted with respect to their compact hosts can warp out-of-plane through general relativistic frame-dragging. Warp influences disc dynamics in ways that have been studied extensively, especially as regards instabilities that might lead to rapid angular-momentum cancellation between neighbouring rings of fluid and mass infall. We provide a review of warped-disc phenomena here, revisiting key hydrodynamical assumptions that impact calculations of the shear viscosity controlling instability thresholds. Relativistic effects at the level of gas-parcel orbits are included, as are external Lorentz forces applied by the compact primary's magnetic field. Semi-analytic analysis reveals that intense magnetic fields can bring about new branches of warp modes and avoided crossings that significantly reduce the perpendicular viscosity at sub-Eddington accretion rates. Critical strengths required for misaligned torques to tear a thin disc may thus relax for systems like neutron star X-ray binaries or radio-loud active galactic nuclei.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22683v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Prediction of multi-wavelength emissions associated with X-ray flare and extended emission of GRBs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22749</link><description>arXiv:2601.22749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are one of the most extreme transients in the universe, but their explosion and emission mechanism remains unclear. To investigate the nature of GRB jets, here we focus on X-ray flares (XFs) and extended emissions (EEs), which are X-ray emissions that occur 100 to 1000 seconds after the main burst. They can be observed by recently developed multi-wavelength facilities. In this paper, we calculate emissions across multi-wavelengths associated with XFs and EEs under the hypothesis that XFs and EEs are optically-thin synchrotron emissions from nonthermal electrons in relativistic jets. Considering ranges of the dissipation radius $r_{\rm diss}$ and the Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the jet, we determine the parameter space in which a detectable emission can be produced at each wavelength. We found that simultaneous ultraviolet and very-high-energy gamma-ray emission associated with XFs or EEs can be detected by Swift/UVOT, SVOM/VT, and CTAO approximately every three years. The detection and non-detection rates for each detector are key to determining the uncertain yet essential values necessary for understanding the physics of GRB jets.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22749v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Rotational Spectroscopy as a Tool to Study Vibration-Rotation Interaction: Investigations of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ and a Search for $v_8 = 2$ Transitions toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22824</link><description>arXiv:2601.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methyl cyanide, CH$_3$CN, is present in diverse regions in space, in particular in the warm parts of star-forming regions where it is a common molecule. Rotational transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 1$ lowest excited vibrational states ($E_{\rm vib} \approx 520$ K) are quite prominent in Sagittarius B2(N). In order to be able to search for transitions of the next higher vibrational state $v_8 = 2$, we recorded spectra of samples enriched in $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN up to $v_8 = 2$ in the 35 to 1091~GHz region and reinvestigated existing spectra of CH$_3$CN in its natural isotopic composition between 1085 and 1200 GHz. Perturbations caused by near-degeneracies in $K = 4$ of $v_8 = 2^0$ and $K = 2$ of $v_8 = 2^{-2}$ yielded accurate information on the energy spacing of 22.93 and 21.79 cm$^{-1}$ between the $l$-components of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN, respectively. Fermi-type interaction between $K = 13$ and 14 of $v_8 = 1^{-1}$ and $v_8 = 2^{+2}$ probe the energy differences between the two states of both isotopomers. In addition, a $\Delta K \pm2$, $\Delta l \mp1$ interaction between the ground vibrational state of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and $v_8 = 1^{+1}$ provides information on their energy spacing. Furthermore, we obtained improved or extended ground state rotational transition frequencies of $^{13}$CH$_3$$^{13}$CN and extensive data for $^{13}$CH$_3$C$^{15}$N and CH$_3$$^{13}$C$^{15}$N. Finally, we report the results of our search for transitions of $^{13}$CH$_3$CN and CH$_3$$^{13}$CN in their $v_8 = 2$ states toward Sagittarius B2(N).</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22824v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Equatorially Asymmetric Magnetic Fields and Their Impact on Black Hole Accretion Dynamics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22894</link><description>arXiv:2601.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field geometry on accretion dynamics around a spinning black hole using axisymmetric general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We consider a Fishbone--Moncrief torus orbiting a Kerr black hole with spin parameter $a = 0.9375$, threaded by large-scale magnetic fields that are asymmetric about the equatorial plane. The degree of equatorial asymmetry in the magnetic field is parametrized by an angle, with values of $30^\circ$, $45^\circ$, and $60^\circ$. We examine how this equatorially asymmetric initial magnetic field configuration influences the magnetic field structure, accretion flow morphology, and angular momentum transport across a range of initial plasma beta values ($\beta = 0.007, 0.005, 0.001$). We find that such deformation in the magnetic field leads to noticeable changes in the inner disk structure, asymmetric outflow patterns in the poloidal plane, and time-dependent variations in accretion rates. These effects are generally more pronounced at lower beta values, where magnetic pressure dominates; in particular, the $30^\circ$ case at $\beta = 0.001$ exhibits strong and persistent asymmetric inflows and outflows. Our results demonstrate that equatorially asymmetric magnetic field configurations can significantly influence the structure and variability of relativistic accretion flows. These findings motivate future extensions to full three-dimensional studies, where black hole magnetosphere can be explored in a more general setting.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.22894v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Sunspot simulations with MURaM -- I. Parameter study using potential field initial conditions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23189</link><description>arXiv:2601.23189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Existing sunspot simulations fail to reproduce the observed magnetic field distribution due to an artificially increased $B_{hor}$ at the upper boundary.
  Aims. We explore alternative ways to better reproduce the magnetic and dynamic properties of observed sunspots.
  Methods. We use the radiative MHD code MURaM. As initial conditions, we placed a potential magnetic field into small-scale dynamo simulations and used potential-field extrapolation at the top.
  Results. We find that: (1) Simulations with increasing initial magnetic field strengths (20, 40, 80, and 160 kG) show larger spots, umbrae, and penumbrae. (2) The penumbral-to-spot sizes are smaller than those measured in observed sunspots. (3) In none of the runs are pure Evershed (radially outward) flows. Instead, bi-directional flows with inflows in the inner penumbra and outflows in the outer penumbra were measured, similar to early observations of penumbra formation for runs with $\ge80$ kG at 96/32 km resolution, whereas runs with 40 kG or less showed pure inflows. (4) Simulations with 160 kG at 32/16 km resolution contain filaments with bi-directional and Evershed flows. (5) Simulations with fluxes $&gt;10^{22}$ Mx show unrealistically strong fields in the umbra. (6) The best runs with 160 kG and $10^{22}$ Mx give realistic radial profiles of $B_z$ and $B_r$, although stronger fields than observed. (7) Increasing the width of the box and reducing the overall flux by subtracting a uniform opposing vertical field have little influence on internal spot dynamics and fields, but change the mean vertical field outside the spot.
  Conclusions. Simulations of small ($10^{22}$) sunspots with an initial potential field and intensified bottom magnetic field strength best reproduce observations of the initial stages of sunspot formation. Numerical resolution may be critical for achieving fully developed penumbrae.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23189v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Evolution of Supermassive Black Hole Pairs on Inclined Orbits in Post-Merger Galaxies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23260</link><description>arXiv:2601.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical models of the evolution of supermassive black hole (SMBH) pairs in post-merger remnant galaxies are necessary to motivate observational searches for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gravitational wave sources. Studies have explored the dynamical evolution of SMBH pairs under the influence of dynamical friction to calculate pairing times and predict the expected population of dual-AGNs at various redshifts. We formulate a three-dimensional dynamical model of SMBH pairs in the innermost kiloparsec of a post-merger galaxy to investigate the impact of orbital inclination with respect to the galactic disk on pairing times. The SMBH pairs are evolved in 81 different galaxy configurations initialized using a Gauss-Seidel Poisson solver. The dynamics are calculated for 12 distinct initial inclinations ranging from 0 to 75 degrees in each of the galaxies to gauge the impact of inclination on pairing time. Orbits characterized by initial inclinations greater than 20 degrees frequently require longer pairing times when compared to uninclined orbits. Pairing times for orbits with inclinations $\gtrsim 45$ degrees often exceed 14 Gyr. Galaxies with higher mass SMBH pairs and faster rotating disks generally shorten pairing times relative to galaxies with less massive or slower rotating disks when the inclination is $\lesssim 45$ degrees. The model suggests that SMBH pairs that form from mergers at inclinations $\lesssim 20$ degrees are likely progenitors of dual-AGN and gravitational wave sources.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.23260v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Zooming-in on cluster radio relics -- I.

Abstract: It is generally accepted that radio relics are the result of synchrotron emission from shock-accelerated electrons. Current models, however, are still unable to explain several aspects of their formation. In this paper, we focus on three outstanding problems: i) Mach number estimates derived from radio data do not agree with those derived from X-ray data, ii) cooling length arguments imply a magnetic field that is at least an order of magnitude larger than the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM), and iii) spectral index variations do not agree with standard cooling models. To solve these problems, we first identify typical shock conditions in cosmological simulations, using the results to inform significantly higher resolution shock-tube simulations. We apply the cosmic ray electron spectra code CREST and the emission code CRAYON+ to these, thereby generating mock observables ab-initio. We identify that upon running into an accretion shock, merger shocks generate a shock-compressed sheet, which, in turn, runs into upstream density fluctuations in pressure equilibrium. This mechanism directly gives rise to solutions to the three problems: it creates a distribution of Mach numbers at the shock-front, which flattens cosmic ray electron spectra, thereby biasing radio-derived Mach number estimates to higher values. We show that this effect is particularly strong in weaker shocks. Secondly, the density sheet becomes Rayleigh-Taylor unstable at the contact discontinuity, causing turbulence and additional compression downstream. This amplifies the magnetic field from ICM-like conditions up to microgauss levels. We show that synchrotron-based measurements are strongly biased by the tail of the distribution here too. Finally, the same instability also breaks the common assumption that matter is advected at the post-shock velocity downstream, thus invalidating laminar-flow based cooling models.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.11947v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-Driven Inverse Cascade</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21141</link><description>arXiv:2509.21141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early universe. A standard numerical approach involves injecting magnetic helicity at intermediate length scales to generate a secondary, time-dependent spectral peak that gradually propagates toward larger scales. Previous simulations have already suggested a resistive dependence of inverse transfer rates and demonstrated the significant influence of magnetic helicity flux density $\epsilon_\mathrm{H}$ on this process. On dimensional grounds, we have $E_\mathrm{M}(k,t)=C_\mathrm{H} \epsilon_\mathrm{H}^{2/3} k^{-1}$ where $C_\mathrm{H}$ represents a potentially universal dimensionless coefficient analogous to the Kolmogorov constant. We present a summary of the 25 distinct simulations conducted with the \textsc{Pencil Code}, systematically varying the forcing wavenumber $k_\mathrm{f}$, magnetic Prandtl number $Pm$, grid resolution $N^3$, and Lundquist number $Lu$. We obtained $C_\mathrm{H}$ and corresponding error bars by calculating the compensated spectrum and investigated its dependence with $Lu$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$. For the $C_\mathrm{H}$ - $Lu$ relationship, we observe strong correlations with power-law exponents of 1 and 2/3. In contrast, we find no significant correlation between $C_\mathrm{H}$ and $k_\mathrm{f}$.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.21141v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Probing Primordial black holes with the distortion of Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13477</link><description>arXiv:2510.13477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB), arising from the incoherent superposition of numerous compact binary coalescences, serves as a powerful probe of both astrophysical populations and fundamental physics. In this work, we investigate the influence of gravitational lensing on the SGWB, focusing on primordial black holes (PBHs) as potential lenses. Assuming PBHs as dark matter candidates with a broad cosmic distribution, we show that their lensing optical depth can be significantly enhanced, producing pronounced effects with relative deviations at the 10^-1 level. By systematically varying the PBH mass (M_PBH) and abundance (f_PBH), we demonstrate that the mass predominantly determines the frequency-dependent diffraction features of the spectrum, while the abundance primarily amplifies the overall lensing-induced deviation. Although the SGWB from binary black holes has not yet been observed, our analytical results provide theoretical insight into the possible imprint of lensing on its spectrum and suggest that future detections could offer a novel avenue to constrain dark matter scenarios.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.13477v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Gravitational-wave and electromagnetic detections in the context of the CosmoDC2 LSST synthetic catalog</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18727</link><description>arXiv:2510.18727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We release CosmoDC2_BCO, a synthetic catalog of gravitational-wave events and electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2. The catalog provides intrinsic and extrinsic source parameters, signal-to-noise ratios, parameter uncertainties, sky localization areas, and kilonova apparent magnitudes in LSST filters. Our results show that third-generation detector networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision, particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which introduce notable uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated detection numbers should be interpreted with appropriate caution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18727v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Photometric Redshifts in JWST Deep Fields: A Pixel-Based Alternative with DeepDISC</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27032</link><description>arXiv:2510.27032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photo-z algorithms that utilize SED template fitting have matured, and are widely adopted for use on high-redshift near-infrared data that provides a unique window into the early universe. Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in ~4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.27032v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Fast variability and circular polarization of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser in G33.641$-$0.228</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20371</link><description>arXiv:2601.20371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 6.7 GHz methanol maser in a high-mass star-forming region G33.641$-$0.228 is known to exhibit burst-like flux variability due to an unknown mechanism. To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0--20\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20371v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07621</link><description>arXiv:2509.07621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. This study investigates how well data-driven fully kinetic simulations can reproduce the ion and electron energy distributions observed during a reconnection event by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission.We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations initialized with plasma parameters derived from the MMS event and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. Key numerical and physical parameters were systematically varied to assess their influence on the resulting particle spectra. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of nonthermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a more pronounced role in reproducing the observed distributions.We present a novel analysis of data-driven fully kinetic simulations of MR, showing that key aspects of particle acceleration can be captured, while also highlighting the limitations of 2D simulations and the need for more realistic (e.g., 3D) setups to reproduce the observed particle energization accurately.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.07621v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Double Stars, Double Disks: Discovering the Young Companion of Herbig Be Star MWC 340</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae225f</link><description>We present the discovery of a young, close-in companion to the early B-type Herbig Be star MWC 340 (V1685 Cyg), a rare system known to host a protoplanetary disk. Herbig Be stars often show complex circumstellar environments shaped by accretion and multiplicity. Using near-infrared (NIR) interferometric observations with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) array over 5 yr in the H band (λ = 1.5–1.7 μm) and K band (λ = 2.1–2.4 μm), we resolve the binary and constrain its orbital and stellar properties through image reconstruction, model fitting, and spectral energy distribution analysis. Orbital modeling suggests a 16 yr minimum period and a 27.5 mas projected separation (≈25 au). Assuming an MA+B = 14.65 M⊙ total mass, we find a best-fit semimajor axis of 21 mas and eccentricity e = 0.69. The reconstructed images reveal a slightly elongated primary that is roughly 3 times brighter than the secondary (flux B/A = 0.28 in the H band, 0.3 in the K band), contributing 65% of the NIR flux. The secondary contributes 21%, with the remainder from extended emission. Stellar photospheres account for only ∼20% of total H- and K-band emission. Isochrone fitting yields masses and ages of 7.5–9 M⊙, 0.13–0.19 Myr for the primary, and 5.8–7 M⊙, 0.28–0.45 Myr for the secondary, suggesting non-coevality unless the secondary is more extinguished. The apparent age discrepancy and high eccentricity ruled out by mass constraints may reflect differential reddening or point to dynamical influence from an unresolved third component. Continued CHARA monitoring and Gaia astrometry will help clarify the system’s architecture.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae225f</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Predicting Dust Temperature from Molecular Line Data Using Machine Learning</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ec3</link><description>We have conducted experiments with machine learning techniques to construct dust temperature maps from the CO isotopolog molecular line data in the Orion A molecular cloud. In classical astrophysical methodology, multiband continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques in deriving dust temperatures in regions without multiband dust continuum data. We have investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences the prediction accuracy and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence the prediction accuracy. We find that ∼5% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The 12CO/13CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the 12CO/13CO ratio is a tracer of photon-dominated regions (PDRs), the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to PDRs. We also find that the condition of the thermal gas–dust coupling is not required for the accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data and that machine learning is capable of capturing more information than classical astrophysical concepts.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ec3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] A τ–DM Relation for Fast Radio Burst Hosts?</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae36a9</link><description>It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times (τ) from fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between τ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a τ–DMhost relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)/Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the τ–DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the τ–DM relation itself, and observational biases against large τ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a τ–DMhost relation is correct.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae36a9</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Are health influencers making us sick?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00313-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 02 February 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00313-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00313-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Social media can help to raise awareness of health conditions — but the wealth of dubious information online might do more harm than good.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00313-5</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Evidence for the Transition from Thermal to Nonthermal Emission in the Prompt Emission of GRB 161117A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ffb</link><description>GRB 161117A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst with three main overlapping peaks. By analyzing the time-resolved spectra of its data observed with the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor on board the Fermi mission, we find that the spectral evolution shows a transition from thermal (single blackbody, hereafter BB) to hybrid (power-law, hereafter PL, +BB), and finally to nonthermal (Band and cutoff PL) emissions. Such a transition suggests that the jet composition of GRB 161117A should be changed from a fireball to a Poynting-flux-dominated jet. The bulk Lorentz factor (Γph), radii (Rph and R0), magnetization factor at the central engine (σ0), and dimensionless entropy (η) of the outflow can be inferred by invoking the observed quasi-thermal component within two models (e.g., pure fireball and hybrid). It is found that Γph seems to be tracking with the light curve, and R0 remains a constant at ∼ 108 cm. The low magnetization (1 + σ0 ∼ 1) and high dimensionless entropy (η ≫ 1) during the first seven time-intervals suggest it to be a pure fireball outflow. Moreover, we also estimate the lower limit of magnetization parameters at the photosphere radius (σph ∼ 1.4 and 0.75) for late phase via the nonthermal spectra, and it indicates that the particle acceleration mechanism is dominated by internal shocks rather than magnetic dissipation processes. Finally, the annihilation mechanism of NDAF model to explain the thermal emission of GRB 161117A is also discussed.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ffb</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Impact of Propagation Effects on the Spectro-temporal Properties of Fast Radio Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3145</link><description>We present a mathematical analysis of propagation-induced distortions in the spectro-temporal properties of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Within the triggered relativistic dynamical model, we derive a centroid-based formulation of the sub-burst slope law, which describes an inverse relation between the sub-burst frequency drift rate and the intrinsic temporal width tw. We extend this framework to include two frequency-dependent propagation effects: (i) multipath scattering, characterized by a pulse-broadening timescale τsc ∝ ν−4, and (ii) residual dispersion, parameterized by ΔDM ∝ ν−2. Our analysis shows that scattered bursts exhibit the same qualitative inverse slope–duration relation but differ quantitatively through a larger scaling coefficient when τsc &gt; tw. Residual DM errors act asymmetrically: under-dedispersion flattens the sub-burst slope, whereas over-dedispersion produces a nonlinear increase and eventual sign change. When both effects are present, scattering counterbalances the steepening induced by over-dedispersion and augments the flattening from under-dedispersion, yielding characteristically distorted curves. We repeat analysis for ultrashort duration bursts (ultra-FRBs) with tw = 50 μs at 1 GHz and find them to be far more sensitive to propagation errors. Deviations become measurable for pc cm−3 and for τsc ∼ 0.1 ms at 1 GHz, levels that have negligible impact on the standard-width sub-bursts. Our analysis provides practical diagnostics to disentangle propagation effects from observed spectro-temporal properties, thereby recovering intrinsic correlations among FRB parameters.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3145</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Investigating the Anisotropy of Dispersion Measure Contribution from the Galactic Halo by Using Fast Radio Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae355a</link><description>We propose a data-driven approach to reconstruct the all-sky distribution of the dispersion measure contribution from the Galactic halo (DMhalo) through a spherical harmonic expansion, enabling an investigation of its possible anisotropies. Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized nonrepeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes ∣b∣ &gt; 15°, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in DMhalo, pointing toward (l = 130°, b = +5°) with a 1σ uncertainty of approximately 28°. The DMhalo value in this direction is 63 ± 9 pc cm−3, exceeding the all-sky mean by about 2.6σ. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic interstellar medium models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of (l = 141°, b = +51°) and a larger 1σ uncertainty of ∼44°. Model comparisons using the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in DMhalo. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae355a</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] An Advanced Identification Method for Gamma-Ray Bursts with Data and Feature Enhancements</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae31f2</link><description>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are challenging to identify due to their transient nature, complex temporal profiles, and limited observational datasets.

The model achieves 97.46% classification accuracy, outperforming all tested variants with conventional enhancement modules, highlighting enhanced domain-specific feature capture. Feature visualization shows the model focuses on deep-seated morphological features and confirms the capability to extract physically meaningful burst characteristics.

Extending the pulse width range of the Fast Radio Burst search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is sensitive to the recently discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients (LPRTs or LPTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, cerberus, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the 90% completeness 25σ flux (fluence) limit to be ∼1200 mJy (∼160 Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g., CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering −3 5 &lt; b &lt; 5 7 and 141° &lt; l &lt; 225° (∼770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates.

We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed by GBM during the 11 yr period of 2010 July–2021 June. In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known event flagging as well as unknown event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms, and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft gamma repeater bursts, Galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently existing list of known events and complements the GBM Trigger Catalog.

Abstract: Stars form as molecular clouds fragment into networks of dense cores, filaments, and subclusters. The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/\pi\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

Abstract: The central engines of Little Red Dots (LRDs) may be ``black hole stars" (BH*s), early stages of black hole growth characterized by dense gas envelopes. So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008\r{A} line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$~$2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $&gt;2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\rm{eff}}$~$4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})$~$43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\rm{eff}}$~$1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta&gt;10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm{\star}}$~$10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008\r{A}~$1100$\r{A}, CIII]~$12$\r{A}), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500\r{A}) -- less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$, lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20929v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] What drives bar rotation? The effect of internal properties and galaxy interactions on bar pattern speeds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20941</link><description>arXiv:2601.20941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main properties of galactic bars is their rotation (or pattern) speed, which is driven by both internal galactic properties, as well as external interactions. To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20941v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Turbulent Dynamo Action in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20953</link><description>arXiv:2601.20953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are expected to generate intense magnetic fields that power relativistic and non-relativistic outflows and shape their multimessenger signatures. These fields likely arise from the turbulent amplification of initially weak magnetic fields during the merger, particularly via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability at the collisional interface between the stars. While previous studies have shown efficient amplification to magnetar-level strengths, the degree of large-scale coherence of the resulting field remains uncertain. We present general-relativistic, dynamical spacetime, magnetohydrodynamic simulations following the evolution of initially weak, pulsar-like magnetic fields in a binary neutron star merger. We find rapid magnetic field growth at small scales with clear signatures of small-scale turbulent dynamo action. At the highest resolutions, we additionally observe the emergence of coherent magnetic structures on larger scales. Our results imply that strong, ordered magnetic fields may be present immediately after merger, with important implications for the subsequent evolution of the remnant and its observable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20953v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Anomalous narrow line Seyfert I galaxies from SDSS DR17</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20957</link><description>arXiv:2601.20957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of 22,656 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 ($0.1\leq z\leq 0.9$), identifying a sample of spectroscopically anomalous sources. These anomalies were detected via the spectroscopic quasar anomaly detection (SQuAD) algorithm, which employed principal component analysis and hierarchical k-means clustering. Various physical diagnostic analysis were performed such as the color excess ($E_{(B-V)}$) calculations, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color analysis, probing O III, equivalent width as an inclination indicator, the BPT diagram and eigenvector 1 diagram. We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\lambda3345$, Ne V $\lambda3426$, Ne III $\lambda3869$ etc). We conclude that the differentiating factor between red and blue NLSy1s is not dust obscuration or orientation effect, but intrinsic distinction in AGN activity. The resulting sample is presented as a value-added catalog.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20957v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Tidal features as tracers of galaxy merger histories: the colours of tidal features in HSC-SSP</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20974</link><description>arXiv:2601.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the radial $g-i$ colour profiles of $\sim$32,000 galaxies drawn from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program optical imaging survey, including 1415 exhibiting tidal features. We compare the colour profiles of galaxies with and without tidal features to extract information about the properties of the mergers that created these features. We find negative colour gradients for both galaxies with and without tidal features and find that tidal feature-hosting red sequence galaxies have redder outskirts than their non-tidal feature hosting counterparts, consistent with the outskirts of these galaxies being dominated by stars accreted from gas-poor minor mergers. We find decreasing mass ratios of tidal features-to-host galaxy with increasing galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that less massive galaxies undergo mergers with companions closer in mass than more massive galaxies. Galaxies exhibiting streams have bluer outskirts than those hosting shells, and shells around red sequence galaxies tend to be more massive and have higher mass ratios to their hosts than streams, consistent with streams being formed from mergers with satellites less massive than those responsible for shells. The agreement between our findings and those of other observational and simulation-based works confirms the validity of our methodology and highlights the value of tidal features colours as a probe into the process through which galaxies evolve.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20974v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Properties of Polarized Radio Sources in the Wide Chandra Deep Field South from 2 to 4GHz</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20982</link><description>arXiv:2601.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the linear polarization properties of radio sources within the 10 deg$^2$ Wide Chandra Deep Field South (W-CDFS) in S-band (2-4 GHz). Our W-CDFS image has an angular resolution of 15 arcsec and a 1$\sigma$ RMS in Stokes $I$ of $\approx$50 $\mu$Jy/beam. We detect 1920 distinct source components in Stokes $I$ and 175 in linear polarization. We examine the polarized source counts, Faraday Rotation measures, and fractional polarization of the sources in the survey. We show that sources with a total intensity above $\approx$10mJy have a mean fractional polarization value of $\approx$3% from modeling the polarized counts. We also calculate an estimate for the limit on the fractional polarization level of sources with a total intensity below 1mJy (mostly star-forming galaxies) of $\stackrel{&lt;}{_{\sim}}$3% using stacking. The mean Faraday Rotation we measure is consistent with that due to the Milky Way. We also show that fractional polarization is correlated with in-band spectral index, consistent with a lower mean fractional polarization for the flat-spectrum population. In addition to characterizing the S-band polarization properties of sources in the W-CDFS, this study will be used to validate the shallower, but higher angular resolution S-band polarimetric information that the VLA Sky Survey will provide for the whole sky above Declination -40 degrees over the next few years.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20982v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Towards precision astrometry of scattered images of compact radio sources: scintillometry theory and prospects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21041</link><description>arXiv:2601.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact radio sources such as pulsars and FRBs undergo scintillation in the interstellar medium (ISM) when scattered images interfere at the observer. ``Scintillometry'' refers to the range of techniques to extract astrometric information -- such as the angular positions of the images and distances to the scattering screen and source -- from scintillation observations. Pulsar scintillometry has proven to be a powerful technique, revealing rich and unexpected scattering phenomenology in the ISM and also shedding light on the emission physics of pulsars. FRB scintillometry stands to be a similarly powerful probe of FRB emission, as well as structure on tiny scales in ionized media beyond our galaxy, such as the circumgalactic medium (CGM). However, nascent FRB scintillation studies are far from the sophisticated lensing geometry reconstructions that have been performed for scintillating pulsars. In this paper, we introduce a novel theoretical framework for scintillometry, demonstrating that the full astrometric content of scintillation observations is contained within a single underlying observable: the instantaneous spatial wavefield. We relate the instantaneous spatial wavefield to more familiar concepts from the pulsar scintillometry literature, such as the dynamic spectrum. Using this framework, we discuss prospects and limitations for FRB scintillometry, towards the goal of full astrometric reconstructions of FRB lensing geometries. We show how key degeneracies in two-screen scattering measurements can be ameliorated. In addition, we discuss the possibility of inferring dispersion measure gradients across scintillation screens, which may shed light on the highly unconstrained physics of the cool CGM phase on tiny ($\sim 100\,{\rm au}$) scales.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21041v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Realizing the phantom-divide crossing with vector and scalar fields</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21274</link><description>arXiv:2601.21274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In generalized Proca theories, characterized by a vector field with broken $U(1)$ gauge invariance, late-time cosmic acceleration can be realized with a dark energy equation of state in the regime $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$. In such scenarios, however, a phantom-divide crossing, as recently suggested by DESI observations, is not achieved without encountering theoretical inconsistencies. We incorporate a canonical scalar field with a potential, in addition to the vector field, and show that the phantom-divide crossing from $w_{\rm DE} &lt; -1$ to $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$ can occur at low redshifts. We propose a minimal model that admits such a transition and identify the region of parameter space in which all dynamical degrees of freedom in the scalar, vector, and tensor sectors are free from ghost and Laplacian instabilities. We further investigate the evolution of linear cosmological perturbations by applying the quasi-static approximation to modes well inside the Hubble radius. The dimensionless quantities $\mu$ and $\Sigma$, which characterize the growth of matter perturbations and the bending of light rays, respectively, depend on the sound speed $c_\psi$ of the longitudinal scalar perturbation associated with the vector field. Since $c_\psi$ is influenced by the transverse vector mode, the model exhibits sufficient flexibility to yield values of $\mu$ and $\Sigma$ close to 1. Consequently, unlike theories such as scalar Galileons, the present model can be consistent with observations of redshift-space distortions and integrated Sachs-Wolfe-galaxy cross-correlations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21274v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cross-correlating galaxies and cosmic dispersion measures: Constraints on the gas-to-halo mass relation from 2MASS galaxies and 133 localized fast radio bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21336</link><description>arXiv:2601.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a cross-correlation analysis between large-scale structures traced by the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) galaxy catalog and the cosmic dispersion measures of 133 localized fast radio bursts (FRBs). The cross-correlation signal is measured as a function of the comoving separation $R$ between 2MASS galaxies and background FRB sightlines, making full use of the available redshift information for both datasets. Our measurements are consistent with a null detection over the range $0.01 &lt; R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] &lt; 1$. Using a halo-based model in which free-electron density profiles are drawn from the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300 (TNG300), we show that the null signal at $R \sim 0.01\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ is inconsistent with the TNG300 prediction. This discrepancy indicates that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos with masses of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ hosting 2MASS galaxies must be lower than that predicted by TNG300. A simple phenomenological modification of the TNG300 model suggests that the hot-gas mass fraction in halos of $10^{12-13}\, M_\odot$ should be below $\sim 10\%$ of the global baryon fraction in the nearby universe, implying the need for stronger feedback in this mass range. Our constraints are consistent with those inferred from X-ray emission and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich measurements in galaxies, while providing a direct estimate of the hot-gas mass fraction that does not rely on electron-temperature measurements. These results demonstrate that galaxy-FRB cross correlations offer a powerful probe of feedback processes in galaxy formation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21336v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cosmological analysis of the DESI DR1 Lyman alpha 1D power spectrum</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21432</link><description>arXiv:2601.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the cosmological analysis of the one-dimensional Lyman-$\alpha$ flux power spectrum from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We capture the dependence of the signal on cosmology and intergalactic medium physics using an emulator trained on a cosmological suite of hydrodynamical simulations, and we correct its predictions for the impact of astrophysical contaminants and systematics, many of these not considered in previous analyses. We employ this framework to constrain the amplitude and logarithmic slope of the linear matter power spectrum at $k_\star=0.009\,\mathrm{km^{-1}s}$ and redshift $z=3$, obtaining $\Delta^2_\star=0.379\pm0.032$ and $n_\star=-2.309\pm0.019$. The robustness of these constraints is validated through the analysis of mocks and a large number of alternative data analysis variations, with cosmological parameters kept blinded throughout the validation process. We then combine our results with constraints from DESI BAO and temperature, polarization, and lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G to set constraints on $\Lambda$CDM extensions. While our measurements do not significantly tighten the limits on the sum of neutrino masses from the combination of these probes, they sharpen the constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_\mathrm{eff}=3.02\pm0.10$, the running of the spectral index, $\alpha_\mathrm{s}=0.0014\pm0.0041$, and the running of the running, $\beta_\mathrm{s}=-0.0006\pm0.0048$, by a factor of 1.18, 1.27, and 1.90, respectively. We conclude by outlining the improvements needed to fully reach the level of confidence implied by these uncertainties.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21432v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Detection of hot subdwarf binaries and sdB stars using machine learning methods and a large sample of Gaia XP spectra</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21727</link><description>arXiv:2601.21727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarfs (hot sds) are compact, evolved stars near the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) and are key to understanding stellar evolution and the ultraviolet excess in galaxies. We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21727v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Asymptotic power spectra and visibilities of damped mixed modes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21745</link><description>arXiv:2601.21745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational studies of red giant stars have estimated the visibility of their mixed oscillation modes, which is a proxy of the average energy of these modes. Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21745v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Progress towards a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code for outflow wind modelling: II. 3-D applications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21782</link><description>arXiv:2601.21782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive hot stars play crucial role in the dynamics of galaxies. These stars influence their surroundings through strong winds which are highly structured processes. The theoretical study of the non-symmetric phenomena of the stellar winds are becoming important these days, mainly because 1-D models are not sufficient enough.
  We present a new version of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Andy Antares with improved treatment of the velocity field for arbitrary geometries. Our aim is to develop a numerical scheme that can incorporate a general velocity field defined at discrete points. Our main objective is to calculate radiative transfer in a general input hydrodynamic model.
  The Andy Antares code currently calculates pure radiative transfer. The input model is pre-calculated by another hydrodynamical code. The whole radiative transfer calculation is then processed in a Cartesian grid. Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path.
  We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes. We also tested the radiative transfer solution on a 3-D model generated from a 2-D hydrodynamic model, and obtained emergent radiation.
  The code is suitable for the numerical solution of radiative transfer in 3-D with arbitrary velocity fields.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21782v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Extreme-Value Distribution Analysis of the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog: Assessing the Rarity of the One-off FRB 20250316A</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21870</link><description>arXiv:2601.21870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical analysis of the extreme brightness of the fast radio burst FRB 20250316A, a luminous, apparently non-repeating event detected by CHIME/FRB. Employing a model-agnostic framework based on the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution applied to the second CHIME/FRB catalog, we quantify its rarity within the current population. Bayesian fitting of GEV models to block maxima of peak flux and fluence data reveals FRB 20250316A to be a profound statistical outlier. For the peak flux, the analysis yields a return period of $\sim$ 600 years ($1\sigma$ credible level), with the underlying distribution being of the heavy-tailed, unbounded Fr\'echet type ($\xi &gt; 0$). The fluence analysis indicates greater complexity: while the full sample suggests a Fr\'echet-type distribution with a $\sim50$-year return period in $1\sigma$ credible level, the removal of three other notable outliers points toward a light-tailed Weibull-type distribution ($\xi &lt; 0$) with a finite upper bound far exceeded by FRB 20250316A. This dichotomy highlights the challenge in characterizing the tail of the FRB luminosity function with limited data. Although less extreme in recurrence time than the ``Brightest Of All Time'' gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A, FRB 20250316A constitutes a similarly exceptional event (a potential FRB ``BOAT'') within the short observational history of wide-field radio surveys. Our results underscore the existence of rare, highly luminous events that may probe the upper limits or distinct sub-populations of the FRB luminosity distribution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.21870v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19053</link><description>arXiv:2501.19053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over $100\,\rm ms$ post-merger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs). Our focus is mainly on the analysis of convective stability and mode characteristics of the massive NSs. We derive stability criteria for hot, differentially rotating relativistic stars that account for both buoyant and rotational restoring forces, and apply them for the first time to the post-merger massive NSs. Our results show no evidence of large-scale convective instability, as both angle-averaged specific entropy and specific angular momentum increase outward within the massive NSs. Rotational effects significantly enhance stability for local regions that would be otherwise unstable by the Schwarzschild criterion. Additionally, our mode analysis of matter fields and gravitational waves reveals no excitation of observable inertial modes after the damping of quadrupolar $f$-modes in the massive NSs, contrasting with previous studies. As in many previous works, we observe the excitation of an $m=1$ one-armed mode. However, we also find that the growth of the $m=1$ mode amplitude after the merger may correlate strongly with the violation of linear momentum conservation, indicating that we cannot reject the possibility that the excitation of the one-armed mode has a numerical origin.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.19053v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A persistent bow shock in a diskless magnetised accreting white dwarf</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07922</link><description>arXiv:2601.07922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07922v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] GRB 171205A/SN 2017iuk: Is the Central Engine a Magnetar?</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae27c0</link><description>It is known that there is an association between long gamma-ray bursts and supernovae (SNe), and study of these SNe is important for exploring the death of massive stars.

We present a catalog characterizing the properties, dynamics, and evolution of m = 2 spiral structure in 10 Milky Way–mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Consistent with previous literature, we find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously present in the disk at varying pattern speeds (Ωp) that broadly decrease with radius. These spirals persist on gigayear timescales (mean duration of 1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of millions of years. Tidal interactions and bar episodes impact the resulting m = 2 spiral structure: strong satellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with larger radial extent, and bars can increase Ωp. Galactic environment influences spiral structure, in which kinematically colder disks can support longer-lived, stronger spirals. The properties of identified spirals in FIRE-2 vary widely in radial extent (0.3–10.8 kpc), duration (1.00–6.00 Gyr), and amplitude (a2,max = 0.018–0.192). We find the presence of spirals in all age populations, suggesting these are density-wave-driven features. This work represents the first time that spiral structure has been cataloged in this manner in cosmological simulations; the catalog can be leveraged with current and forthcoming observational surveys, enabling systematic comparisons to further our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2be1</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Carbonaceous Cosmic Dust Analogs Distinguish between Ion Bombardment and Temperature</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2bfe</link><description>Carbonaceous cosmic dust is formed in the circumstellar envelopes of asymptotic giant branch stars and supernovae ejecta. Reprocessed carbonaceous cosmic dust, abundant in the light elements C, H, O, and N is found in asteroids and comets. These elements form dust that is well described as an amorphous, covalently bonded network solid with a structure that is expected to reflect the key formative influences of ion bombardment, temperature modification, and UV irradiation. Ion bombardment of a dust grain by an energetic particle in a stellar wind creates a nonequilibrium thermal spike event, which contrasts with the close-to-equilibrium process of annealing under the local ambient conditions. There is a gap in our knowledge of how to distinguish ion bombardment as a synthesis process from postsynthesis thermal modification through infrared spectroscopy. Here we synthesize dust from molecular precursors under a range of controlled space-like conditions to form a database of IR spectra. We apply principal component analysis to show that the first principal component correlates with ion bombardment intensity during synthesis and the second principal component correlates with annealing temperature. The spectral loading curves of these two principal components are proposed as potential diagnostic tools to uncover past formative influences on cosmic dust as well as on the carbonaceous content of asteroids such as Bennu and Ryugu. Amorphous organic networks composed of the CHON elements unify previous ideas on cosmic dust by encompassing features of PAHs, tholins, and mixed aliphatic–aromatic nanoparticles.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2bfe</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Study of the Orientation of Erupting Magnetic Flux Ropes in Coronal Mass Ejections from the Solar Corona to 1 au</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c7a</link><description>The southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field, often originating from solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs), plays a crucial role in driving geomagnetic storms. Accurate prediction of the flux rope orientation of CMEs as they arrive at Earth requires a clear understanding of how the orientation of magnetic flux ropes evolves from the solar corona to 1 au. In this study, we investigated six geoeffective CMEs, initiated either from active regions (ARs; three events) or quiet-Sun (QS) filament eruptions (three events). The orientation prior to the eruption is determined by the eruptive filament or the magnetic flux rope near the solar surface. During the CME propagation away from the Sun, the graduated cylindrical shell model and the Grad–Shafranov technique are used to estimate the orientation of the CME magnetic field structure. Our results show that the orientation of flux ropes associated with QS eruptions did not change from the Sun to 1 au. For three rotating events initiated from ARs, the direction of rotation remains consistent during the propagation from the Sun to 1 au. The trend indicates that the heliospheric current sheet has a relatively limited influence on these events. For rotating events, the direction of rotation basically follows the prediction of Lynch’s model.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c7a</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] CHIME/FRB Discovery of the Extremely Active Fast Radio Burst Source FRB 20240114A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2fc4</link><description>Among the thousands of observed fast radio bursts (FRBs), a few sources exhibit exceptionally high burst activity observable by many telescopes across a broad range of radio frequencies. Almost all of these highly active repeaters have been discovered by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment/FRB project (CHIME/FRB), due to its daily observations of the entire northern sky as a transit radio telescope. FRB 20240114A is a source discovered and reported by CHIME/FRB to the community in 2024 January; given its low declination, even the detection of a few bursts hints at a high burst rate. Following the community announcement of this source as a potentially active repeater, it was extensively followed up by other observatories and has emerged as one of the most prolific FRB repeaters ever observed. This paper presents the five bursts CHIME/FRB observed from FRB 20240114A, with channelized raw voltage data saved for two bursts. We do not observe changes in the dispersion measure of the source greater than ∼1.3 pc cm−3 in our observations over a nearly 1 yr baseline. We find a rotation measure of ∼+320 rad m−2. We do not find evidence for scattering at the level of &lt;0.3 ms in the bursts, and we find no evidence for astrophysical scintillation. In our observations of FRB 20240114A, we see a burst rate ∼49 times higher than the median upper limit on the burst rate of apparent nonrepeaters also discovered by CHIME/FRB. With many thousands of bursts observed to date, FRB 20240114A has given the field an extraordinary opportunity to extensively study an FRB and understand its origins.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2fc4</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Clumpy, Dense Gas in the Outflow of NGC 1266</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c5a</link><description>Outflows are one of the most spectacular mechanisms through which active galactic nuclei (AGN) impact their host galaxy, though the role of AGN-driven outflows in global star formation regulation across the galaxy population is unclear. NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D ∼ 30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2–1) and yield a lower limit of 12CO/13CO ≥ 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1–0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1–0)/12CO(1–0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and luminous infrared galaxies. We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1–0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of &lt;85 M⊙ yr–1. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoir in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c5a</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] BREAKFAST: A Framework for General Joint Burst Advocate Duty and Follow-up Guidance of Multiple Gamma-Ray Monitors</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2eae</link><description>With the growing number of gamma-ray monitors in operation, several research teams have adopted a strategy of joint operation and scientific duty to improve efficiency. A successful example is the GECAM–HXMT–SVOM (GHS) constellation collaboration, which sets a precedent for other gamma-ray monitor constellations. However, joint duty also presents challenges to burst advocates (BAs), including an increased number of triggers and, more importantly, frequent switching between various systems due to incompatibilities among different missions, which complicates the situation. To address the current requirements of multiwavelength and multimessenger astronomy, we developed a customized framework for unified trigger processing within the GHS joint duty, named “BAs’ Rapid Evaluation and Analysis Kit for Formulating Alerts and Summary Tools” (BREAKFAST). This framework incorporates a series of automated, semiautomated, and manual pipelines designed to rapidly process triggers of prompt emissions in the gamma-ray band from different instruments, while maintaining flexible compatibility for future missions. The pursuit of BREAKFAST goes beyond merely providing trigger processing for BAs. BREAKFAST also aims to identify high-value targets through rapid analysis and to guide follow-up telescopes by providing timely reports, thereby serving as an important bridge between prompt-emission observations and afterglow observations. To this end, a suite of comprehensive analysis modules is included in BREAKFAST, particularly the specially designed module that predicts X-ray afterglow brightness based on prompt-emission properties. The framework’s effectiveness has already been demonstrated in recent observational campaigns, and it is expected to play a significant role in the discovery and observation of peculiar transients in the future.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2eae</guid></item><item><title>[Nature Astronom] A binary model of long-period radio transients and white dwarf pulsars</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02760-y</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature Astronomy, Published online: 30 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-025-02760-y"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41550-025-02760-y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Long-period radio transients emit periodic radio pulses of unknown origin.

Abstract: Transient noise artifacts, or glitches, fundamentally limit the sensitivity of gravitational-wave (GW) interferometers and can mimic true astrophysical signals, particularly the short-duration intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) mergers. Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant ``label bottleneck," requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20034v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Twenty-four thousand hours of GREENBURST observations with the GBT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20143</link><description>arXiv:2601.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to fast radio burst (FRB) searches carried out using dedicated surveys, a number of radio observatories take advantage of commensal opportunities with large facilities in which observations for other projects can be searched for FRBs and other transient sources. We present the results from one such effort, the first 24,186 hours of the GREENBURST search for dispersed radio pulses with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). To date, GREENBURST has detected a total of 50 pulsars and three FRBs. One of the pulsars, PSR J0039+5407, has a period of 2.2 s and was previously unknown. Using follow-up observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, we found a timing solution for this pulsar which shows it to have a characteristic age of 2 Myr. Additional GBT observations show the pulsar has a very high nulling fraction ($\sim70-80\%$). All three of the FRBs are repeating sources that were previously known and were being monitored by the GBT as part of other projects. A major challenge for GREENBURST in the discovery of new FRBs is its single beam. This makes it hard to distinguish some of the pulses from sources of radio frequency interference. We highlight this problem with a case study of an FRB-like pulse that initially passed our interference filters. Upon closer inspection, the event appears to be part of a longer-duration narrow-band source of unknown origin. Further observations and monitoring are required to determine whether it is terrestrial or celestial.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20143v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A dynamical systems approach to studying the equivalence principle in dilaton gravity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20156</link><description>arXiv:2601.20156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a string-inspired dilaton cosmology in the Damour--Polyakov (DP) regime using dynamical-systems methods, aiming to make explicit how cosmological relaxation controls deviations from the equivalence principle. Working in the Einstein frame, we consider a spatially flat FLRW universe filled with pressureless matter and a universally coupled dilaton. Expanding the conformal coupling function and the scalar potential around the least-coupling point, we obtain a closed and self-consistent autonomous system governing the late-time evolution of the scalar-matter sector. The resulting phase space contains a stable fixed point associated with least coupling, approached only asymptotically along cosmological trajectories. Therefore, at any finite epoch the solution typically retains a small displacement from the fixed point. In the DP regime this finite-epoch displacement sets the ambient coupling, and thus determines the magnitude of fifth-force effects and deviations from the equivalence principle in the nonrelativistic limit. By linearising the system around a finite-epoch reference state, we show that the damping of the displacement is controlled by the Jacobian eigenvalues of the DP fixed point. This yields a direct dynamical estimate of how rapidly deviations from the equivalence principle are reduced during cosmological evolution. The mechanism is global and cosmological in origin, and is conceptually distinct from local environmental screening as in chameleon or symmetron scenarios. Overall, our results illustrate how phase-space techniques provide a clear bridge between cosmological dynamics and weak-field departures from General Relativity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20156v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Self-consistent $N$-body simulation of Planetesimal-Driven Migration.

Abstract: According to the canonical planet formation theory, planets form "in-situ" within a planetesimal disk via runaway and oligarchic growth. This theory, however, cannot naturally account for the formation timescale of ice giants or the existence of diverse exoplanetary systems. Planetary migration is a key to resolving these problems. One well-known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which can let planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering of planetesimals. In our previous paper (Jinno et al. 2024, PASJ, 76, 1309), we investigated the migration of a single planet through PDM, addressing previously unexplored aspects of both the gravitational interactions among planetesimals and the interactions with disk gas. Here we perform the first high-resolution simulations of planet formation from a large-scale planetesimal disk, incorporating planet-gas disk interactions, planet-planetesimal interactions, gravitational interactions among all planetesimals, and physical collisions between planetesimals to investigate the role of PDM in the planet formation process. Our results show that protoplanets undergo dynamic inward/outward migrations during the runaway growth stage via PDM. Moreover, orbital repulsion combined with PDM tends to make two groups of protoplanets, outer ones going outward and inner ones going inward. Such dynamic migration significantly influences the early stages of planetary formation. These findings provide a viable pathway for the formation of Earth-like planets and ice giants' cores. Furthermore, they suggest that a standard protoplanetary disk model can account for the planetary migration necessary to explain diverse exoplanetary systems without the need for additional hypotheses.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20348v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Fast variability and circular polarization of the 6.7 GHz methanol maser in G33.641$-$0.228</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20371</link><description>arXiv:2601.20371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 6.7 GHz methanol maser in a high-mass star-forming region G33.641$-$0.228 is known to exhibit burst-like flux variability due to an unknown mechanism. To investigate the burst mechanism, we conducted high-cadence flux and circular polarization monitoring observations, simultaneously using left- and right-hand circular polarizations. We found that the flux density increased and decreased on a short timescale of 0.3 d during a burst. We also found strong circular polarization, reaching up to 20\% in the component exhibiting the bursts. Circular polarization of 0--20\% was continuously observed from 2009 to 2016, even in the quiescent period. The polarization also varied on timescales of less than one day. When a burst occurred and the flux density increased, the circular polarization decreased to zero. To explain the observational properties of the flux variability and circular polarization, we propose a model in which an explosive event similar to a solar radio burst occurs on the line of sight behind the maser cloud, producing circularly polarized continuum emission due to gyro-synchrotron or gyro-resonance radiation, which is then amplified by the maser.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20371v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The IACOB project: XVI. Surface helium abundances in Galactic O-type stars: indications for identifying binary interaction products</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20698</link><description>arXiv:2601.20698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of massive O-type stars with surfaces enriched by CNO-cycle products has been known since the early 1980s. For many years, internal rotational mixing was assumed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for this chemical contamination. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that binary interaction -- particularly mass-transfer episodes -- may play an equally important, if not dominant, role. We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe&gt;0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20698v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] General Scalar Field Inflation ACT Attractors: Utilizing the $n_s(r)$ relation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20053</link><description>arXiv:2601.20053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ACT data have severely constrained the single scalar field models. Known models of inflation, like the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors are at least $2\sigma$ off the ACT data. In this work we aim to provide a top-to-bottom approach in single scalar field inflationary cosmology compatible with the ACT data. Specifically, inspired by the fact that the Starobinsky model, the Higgs model and the $a$-attractors, all being plateau potentials, result to the same attractor relation between the spectral index of scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, which is of the form $n_s(r)=1-\alpha r^{1/2}$, in this work we seek for attractors of the form $n_s(r)=f(r)$ that may lead to ACT-compatible inflation. Specifically, we fix the function $f(r)$ to have a specific desirable form and then solve the differential equation $n_s(r)=f(r)$ to find the potential which results to the relation $n_s(r)=f(r)$. We discovered analytically three classes of potentials which are variants of the general form $n_s(r)=\gamma \pm \beta r \pm r^{1/2}$ and all these models are found to be compatible with the ACT data.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20053v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Graviton energy spectra arising from the KSVZ axion model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20767</link><description>arXiv:2601.20767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion, the goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a global $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn symmetry, provides a dynamical solution to the strong CP problem and is an excellent dark matter candidate. Various experiments are designed to search for the axion, however no confirmative signal has been observed. On the other hand, there are also hypothetical heavy particles in axion models, such as the heavy scalar $s$, which is the CP-even component of the complex scalar that carries $U(1)_{PQ}$ charge, and the vector-like heavy quark (VLQ) in the Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov~(KSVZ) axion model. Studying signals induced by them are helpful for axion searches. In this paper, we calculate the graviton bremsstrahlung energy spectrum arising from the decay of the heavy scalar or VLQ in the KSVZ model. The result shows that these heavy particles can emit ultrahigh-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), with the peak frequency depending on the model's parameter inputs. In addition, the graviton spectrum is distinguished from the thermal GW background at high frequencies if there is an early matter-dominated era induced by these heavy particles. Future measurements of ultrahigh-frequency GWs may provide indirect evidence for the KSVZ axion.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.20767v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Semi-analytic studies of accretion disk and magnetic field geometry in M87*</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11760</link><description>arXiv:2508.11760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: Magnetic fields play a pivotal role in dynamics of black hole accretion flows and formation of relativistic jets. Observations by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provided unprecedented insights into accretion structures near black holes. Interpreting these observations requires a theoretical framework linking polarized emission to underlying system properties and magnetic field geometries. Aims: We investigate how system properties, particularly magnetic field geometry in the event horizon scale region, influence the structure of the observable synchrotron emission in M87*. Specifically, we aim to quantify the sensitivity of observables used by the EHT to black hole spin, plasma dynamics, accretion disk thickness, and magnetic field geometry. Methods: We adopt a semi-analytic radiatively inefficient accretion flow model in Kerr spacetime. We vary magnetic field geometry, black hole spin, accretion disk dynamics, and geometric thickness of the disk. We perform general relativistic ray tracing with a full polarized radiative transfer to obtain synthetic images of M87*. We extract EHT observables, such as disk diameter, asymmetry, and polarimetric metrics from synthetic models. We also consider a number of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations and compare them with the semi-analytical models. Results: We see limited impact of the disk thickness on observables. On the other hand, toroidal field dominated and poloidal field dominated magnetic configurations can be distinguished reliably. The flow dynamics, in particular presence of radial inflow, also significantly impacts the EHT observables.

Abstract: Observing giant HII regions at fine spatial scales uncovers detailed structures and reveals variations in ionization, abundance, and dynamical properties of ionized gas and the effect of stellar feedback. Using emission line data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the principal optical emission line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous HII region in M33. The excitation maps align well with the H$\alpha$ morphology and are clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and secondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show substantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these variations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily caused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios. We present the H$\alpha$ kinematics of the region and connect it to the excitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial distribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these excitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary nebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the overall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution spatial data. Throughout the paper, we make comparisons to and raise concerns about single-aperture and long-slit spectroscopic measurements of giant HII regions, highlighting the limitations and potential inaccuracies of such methods.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.03144v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Next-Generation Improvements in Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary and Structural Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08681</link><description>arXiv:2510.08681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many evolutionary models of giant exoplanets still rely on simplifying assumptions that are no longer adequate given detailed constraints from Jupiter, Saturn, and modern exoplanet observations. Here, we identify the key physical improvements required for next-generation planetary evolution models using our code, \texttt{APPLE}, which enables systematic emulation and extension of legacy studies. We quantify the effects of updated equations of state, helium rain, fuzzy cores, non-adiabatic and compositionally inhomogeneous envelopes, and improved atmospheric boundary conditions by first isolating the impact of each physical ingredient and then constructing combined baseline models for planets with masses between 0.3 and 4~$M_{\rm Jup}$ to assess their collective influence on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences ($\sim 5$ to 10\%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by $\sim$ 5 to 20\%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08681v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Rapidly rotating hot nuclear and hypernuclear compact stars: integral parameters and universal relations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16239</link><description>arXiv:2510.16239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.16239v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Origins of the Bulk flow</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03168</link><description>arXiv:2512.03168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the origin of the large-scale bulk flow using the CosmicFlows-4 (CF4) peculiar-velocity catalog. We decompose the observed motions into internal components, generated by mass fluctuations within 200 Mpc/h, and external ones arising from structures beyond this volume. A weighted-average technique is developed to test the model's self-consistency while minimizing the impact of non-Gaussian distance errors. The CF4 velocities show excellent agreement with the predicted internal field, yielding beta = 0.31 pm 0.01. We also determine that the value of the Hubble constant that should be used for calculating peculiar velocities from the CF4 to be H0 = 75.0 pm 0.1 km/s/Mpc, consistent with CF4 calibrations. Using the minimum-variance formalism, we further separate the bulk flow into its internal and external contributions and find that the observed large-scale bulk flow is dominated by sources beyond 200 Mpc/h. The amplitude of this externally driven flow increases monotonically with scale, consistent with the influence of a distant, massive overdensity. These findings reinforce the reliability of the CF4 velocity field while calling into question the assumption of a spatially uniform flow generated by external sources. Our results challenge the commonly made hypothesis that the flow in our local volume due to external mass concentrations can be modeled as being spatially uniform.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.03168v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Inflationary dynamics of non-minimally coupled $f(R)$ matter-curvature theories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01532</link><description>arXiv:2509.01532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by $f(R)$ theories with a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above $10^{13}$ GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.01532v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Constraining a de Broglie--Bohm quantum bounce cosmology with Planck data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18022</link><description>arXiv:2510.18022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates a singularity-free early Universe within the paradigm of quantum cosmology. We develop a bouncing model where the singularity is resolved via the de Broglie--Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics, which provides a deterministic trajectory for the scale factor through a quantum bounce. The primordial power spectrum for scalar perturbations is derived, incorporating a characteristic modulation (distortion function) imprinted by the nonstandard quantum gravitational dynamics near the bounce. We confront this model with the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background data, establishing its strong compatibility with observations. Our analysis places a stringent upper bound on the fundamental scale of the bounce $k_B$, constraining the parameter space of such quantum cosmological scenarios. {}Furthermore, the model's specific scale-dependent anticorrelation between the spectral index and amplitude of perturbations offers a potential mechanism for mitigating the $H_0$-$\sigma_8$ tension, presenting a testable signature for future cosmological surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18022v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Deuterium Fractionation and CO Depletion in Barnard 5</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c57</link><description>Deuterium fractionation provides a key diagnostic of the physical and chemical evolution of prestellar and protostellar cores, where it is strongly linked to CO depletion in cold, dense gas. We present the first spatially resolved maps of deuterium fraction and CO depletion in the Barnard 5 region of the Perseus molecular cloud, covering both a starless core and the protostellar core hosting the Class 0/I source IRAS 03445+3242. Using IRAM 30 m observations of N2H+(1–0), N2D+(1–0), H13CO+(1–0), and DCO+(2–1), complemented by C18O(2–1) data, we derive column density, deuterium fraction, and CO depletion maps.

Early alerts favored a neutron-star-containing merger, making this a compelling target. Motivated by theoretical predictions of coherent radio bursts from mergers involving a neutron star, we utilized the OVRO-LWA Time Machine system to analyze voltage data recorded around the time of the event. Time Machine is a two-stage voltage buffer and processing pipeline that continuously buffers raw data from all antennas across the array’s nearly full-hemisphere instantaneous field of view, enabling retrospective beamforming, dedispersion, and fast-transient candidate identification. For this event, we analyzed a 30 minute interval beginning 3.5 minutes after the merger, which included 2 minutes of pre-alert data recovered by the ring buffer. We searched the 50% localization probability region with millisecond time resolution in the 69–86 MHz frequency band. No radio counterpart was detected above a 7σ fluence detection threshold of ∼150 Jy ms. Using Bayesian analysis, we place a 95% confidence upper limit on the source luminosity of L95 = 4 × 1041 erg s−1. These constraints start to probe the bright end of the coherent-emission parameter space predicted by jet–interstellar medium shock processes, magnetar and blitzar-like mechanisms, and recent simulation-based scenarios for neutron-star-containing mergers. This study presents the first sensitive, large-area, millisecond-timescale search for prompt low-frequency radio emission from a GW merger with the OVRO-LWA, establishing a framework in which about 10 additional events will yield stringent population-level constraints.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ea3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] On the Ultralong Gamma-Ray Transient GRB 250702B/EP 250702a</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae31e7</link><description>GRB 250702B/EP 250702a is an interesting long-duration gamma-ray transient whose nature is in debate. To obtain a full picture in the gamma-ray band, we implement a comprehensive targeted search of burst emission in a wide window of 30 days jointly with Insight-HXMT, GECAM, and Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor data within the ETJASMIN framework. In the gamma-ray band, we find that there is a 50 s precursor about 25 hr before the 4 hr main burst, which generally consists of four emission episodes. Remarkably, we find that the soft X-ray emission after the main burst decays as a power law with a start time aligning with the last episode of main emission and an index of −5/3, which is perfectly consistent with the canonical prediction of fallback accretion. We conclude that the properties of the precursor, the main burst, and the following soft X-ray emission strongly support the ultralong gamma-ray burst (ULGRB) scenario, and all this gamma-ray and soft X-ray emission probably originates from a relativistic jet whose luminosity is dominated by the fallback accretion rate during the death collapse of a supergiant star.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae31e7</guid></item><item><title>[The Astronomica] Improving Generalization and Uncertainty Quantification of Photometric Redshift Models</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae2ffe</link><description>Accurate redshift estimates are a vital component in understanding galaxy evolution and precision cosmology. In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband (∼35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset, and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-z science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-z's 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.5, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-z's for a broader galaxy population, which is crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.</description><author>The Astronomical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae2ffe</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Resistive Scaling in the Magnetic Helicity-driven Inverse Cascade</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae31e6</link><description>The inverse cascade in MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in various astrophysical processes such as galaxy cluster formation, solar and stellar dynamo mechanisms, and the evolution of primordial magnetic fields in the early Universe.

Abstract: We investigate induced Compton/Brillouin scattering of electromagnetic waves in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma by verifying kinetic theory with Particle-in-Cell simulations. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs) in magnetar magnetospheres, we find that the scattering--although suppressed by the magnetic field--inevitably enters the linear growth stage. The subsequent evolution bifurcates: full scattering occurs when the density exceeds a critical value, whereas below it the scattering saturates and the FRB can escape. This eases the tension with observations of compact emission regions and may explain the observed diversity, including the presence or absence of FRBs associated with X-ray bursts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18865v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Multiwavelength Analysis of Six Luminous, Fast Blue Optical Transients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18926</link><description>arXiv:2601.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multiwavelength observations and analysis of six luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) discovered in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey data. We identified these LFBOTs from their fast light-curve evolution ($t_{1/2}\leq 12 $d), blue colors at peak brightness ($g-r\leq-0.5 $mag), a visible host galaxy, high optical luminosity ($M_g&lt;-20$), and an X-ray or radio detection.
  With the exception of AT2024aehp (ZTF24abygbss), these transients exhibit peaks in their $10\,$GHz radio light curves at $t_{\text{rest}} \approx 50-100$ d, with peak radio luminosities ranging from $10^{38}-10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Modeling the radio emission as synchrotron radiation indicates a fast ($v=0.1-0.3c$) shock in a dense ($n_e\approx10^{3}-10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) medium. The X-ray emission varies by $\approx2$ orders of magnitude in luminosity ($10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) at $t_{\text{rest}}\sim20 $d.
  Analysis of the host-galaxy photometry and spectroscopy for each transient shows that they are predominantly nonnuclear (a few kpc offset) with star-forming host galaxies of stellar masses $10^{9}-10^{11} ,M_\odot$.
  Unlike all other LFBOTs to date, AT2024aehp exhibited a luminous ($M&lt;-19 $mag) plateau in the optical light curve; spectra during this plateau phase showed a featureless blue continuum. The $6-15$ GHz radio emission of AT2024aehp brightened by over an order of magnitude from $t_{\text{rest}} \approx70 $d to $t_{\mathrm{rest}} \approx130 $d.
  The mostly consistent radio behavior between optically selected LFBOTs implies a similar circumburst medium, leading us to prefer a progenitor scenario in which mass is lost in a consistent way shortly prior to the terminal event, such as a massive star merging with a compact object.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18926v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Maximum Energy of Particles Accelerated in GRB Afterglow Shocks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19135</link><description>arXiv:2601.19135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19135v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Latent characterisation of the complete BATSE gamma ray bursts catalogue using Gaussian mixture of factor analysers and model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19140</link><description>arXiv:2601.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterising and distinguishing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has interested astronomers for many decades. While some authors have found two or three groups of GRBs by analyzing only a few parameters, recent work identified five ellipsoidally-shaped groups upon considering nine parameters $T_{50}, T_{90}, F_1, F_2, F_3, F_4, P_{64}, P_{256}, P_{1024}$. Yet others suggest sub-classes within the two or three groups found earlier. Using a mixture model of Gaussian factor analysers, we analysed 1150 GRBs, that had nine parameters observed, from the current Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) catalogue, and again established five ellipsoidal-shaped groups to describe the GRBs. These five groups are characterised in terms of their average duration, fluence and spectrum as shorter-faint-hard, long-intermediate-soft, long-intermediate-intermediate, long-bright-intermediate and short-faint-hard. The use of factor analysers in describing individual group densities allows for a more thorough group-wise characterisation of the parameters in terms of a few latent features. However, given the discrepancy with many other existing studies that advocated for two or three groups, we also performed model-estimated overlap-based syncytial clustering (MOBSynC) that successively merges poorer-separated groups. The five ellipsoidal groups merge into three and then into two groups, one with GRBs of low durations and the other having longer duration GRBs. These groups are also characterised in terms of a few latent factors made up of the nine parameters. Our analysis provides context for all three sets of results, and in doing so, details a multi-layered characterisation of the BATSE GRBs, while also explaining the structure in their variability.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19140v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Constraining FRB Microstructure with Polarised Shot Noise</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19254</link><description>arXiv:2601.19254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FIRES, a polarised shot-noise framework that models fast radio burst (FRB) dynamic spectra as the incoherent superposition of Gaussian microshots. Applied to the CRAFT bursts FRB 20191001A and FRB 20240318A, FIRES reproduces key spectro-polarimetric behaviours: scattering suppresses position-angle (PA) variability on the trailing edge, while the leading edge preferentially retains intrinsic structure when sufficient signal-to-noise is present. We quantify this behaviour using the PA variance ratio $\mathcal{R}_\psi$ and explore the joint plane of measured linear polarisation fraction $\Pi_L$ versus PA variance to constrain the allowed parameter space of microshot number $N$, intrinsic PA dispersion $\sigma_\psi$, and intrinsic linear fraction $\Pi_{L,0}$ at fixed signal-to-noise. For FRB~20191001A, the data are consistent with an extended region spanning $\sigma_\psi \sim 10^\circ$--$30^\circ$ and $N \sim 5$--$1000$, reflecting degeneracies between intrinsic PA structure, microshot superposition, scattering, finite sampling, and noise. FRB~20240318A occupies a more restricted region, favouring fewer microshots ($N \lesssim 20$) and larger intrinsic PA dispersion ($\sigma_\psi \sim 15$--$23^\circ$), depending on $\Pi_{L,0}$, consistent with its observed PA variability. By combining an emission-mechanism-independent framework with minimal assumptions and observational constraints, FIRES provides direct, quantitative constraints on the space of viable FRB microphysical models and demonstrates that microshot superposition offers a natural explanation for the diverse polarimetric behaviours observed in FRBs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19254v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Local environmental dependence on weak-lensing shear statistics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19268</link><description>arXiv:2601.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the assumption that an ideal FLRW observer is not dependent on the local environment, observations are biased by the positions of the observers due to the matter correlations in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The variation of the mass distribution of the LSS of the universe implies that observers residing in different locations may suffer bias in their measurements when they look at the images of distant galaxies. Here, we assess the influence of the local environment on weak gravitational lensing (WL) shear statistics in the context of relativistic $N$-body code, \texttt{gevolution}. We derive numerical constraints on the cosmological parameters from the WL shear angular power spectrum and comment on the local environment's influence on WL shear. We find tighter constraints on the parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ above redshift $z$ = 0.2, which implies over this redshift the local environment's impact is minor. We also investigate the bispectrum and conclude that on average the impact of the local environment on $f_{\rm NL}$ (a measure of non-Gaussianities) is minimal and consistent with zero effect. However, we find that within the assembly of all possible observers/locations, there will also be a few that could infer the parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ of the order 10. These results could thus be used to estimate the uncertainty in the inference of cosmological parameters such as $f_{\rm NL}$ based on WL shear bispectrum and thus may have implications for future surveys requiring precision at the percent level.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19268v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] CH3CCH as a thermometer in warm molecular gas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19344</link><description>arXiv:2601.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic temperature is a fundamental parameter in molecular clouds. Symmetric top molecules, such as NH$_3$ and CH$_3$CCH, are often used as thermometers. However, at high temperatures, NH$_3$(2,2) can be collisionally excited to NH$_3$(2,1) and rapidly decay to NH$_3$(1,1), which can lead to an underestimation of the kinetic temperature when using rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2). In contrast, CH$_3$CCH is a symmetric top molecule with lower critical densities of its rotational levels than those of NH$_3$, which can be thermalized close to the kinetic temperature at relatively low densities of about 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. To compare the rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) and CH$_3$CCH rotational levels in warm molecular gas, we used observational data toward 55 massive star-forming regions obtained with Yebes 40m and TMRT 65m. Our results show that rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) are systematically lower than those from CH$_3$CCH 5-4. This suggests that CH$_3$CCH rotational lines with the same $J$+1$\rightarrow$$J$ quantum number may be a more reliable thermometer than NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) in warm molecular gas located in the surroundings of massive young stellar objects or, more generally, in massive star-forming regions.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19344v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Numerical simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with equal and near-equal mass ratios</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19405</link><description>arXiv:2601.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of GW230529_181500 suggested the existence of more symmetric black hole-neutron star mergers where the black hole mass can be as low as 2.6 times that of the neutron star. Black hole-neutron star binaries with even more symmetric mass ratios are expected to leave behind massive disks capable of driving bright electromagnetic transients like kilonovae. Currently, there is only a limited number of numerical-relativity simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers in this regime, which are vital for accurate gravitational waveform models and analytical fitting formulas for the remnant properties. Insufficient accuracy of these may lead to misclassification of real events and potentially missed opportunities to locate their electromagnetic counterparts. To fill this gap in the parameter space coverage, we perform simulations of black hole-neutron star mergers with mass ratios $q \in \{1, 1/2, 1/3\}$. We find the gravitational waveform models do not show good agreement with the numerical waveforms, with dephasing at the level of around 1 rad at the merger. We find that the masses of the dynamical ejecta and disk are in good agreement with the available fitting formulas. The analytical formulas for the remnant black hole are in excellent agreement for the black hole mass, but are less accurate with the predictions for its spin. Moreover, we analyze the remnant disk structure and dynamics, deriving the rotation law and identifying global trapped $g$-mode density oscillations. We distinguish three types of accretion in the postmerger and find modulation of the accretion rate by the global oscillations of the disk. Finally, we model the kilonova emission these systems would produce and find that most of them are potentially detectable by Vera C. Rubin Observatory within four days after merger, and by DECam within two days after merger if located at a distance of 200 Mpc.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19405v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Union3.1: Self-consistent Measurements of Host Galaxy Properties for 2000 Type Ia Supernovae</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19424</link><description>arXiv:2601.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of distances using time-series photometry of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) relies on a ~5% empirical correction related to the properties of their host galaxies, e.g., global stellar mass. It is therefore crucial for unbiased cosmology inference that host galaxy properties be self-consistently determined across the full range of redshifts probed, which we undertake in this study for approximately 2000 SNe in the Union3 compilation (now Union3.1). We use aperture-matched, homogeneously-reduced, optical-infrared photometry from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys to derive global galaxy properties using the stellar population synthesis and SED-fitting code Prospector. We find that the host masses of $z&lt;0.10$ SNe in Union3 were, on average, overestimated relative to the rest of the sample, while the opposite was true for $z&lt;0.15$ SNe in Pantheon+. After correction, the two studies' average distance modulus estimated for low-redshift SNe, previously $&gt;0.03$ mag discrepant, come into 0.01 mag agreement. We then update the UNITY SN analysis and find that the uncertainties on all standardization parameters shrink to 0.6-0.9x their previous sizes. For flat-$\Lambda$CDM, we find $\Omega_m=0.344^{+0.026}_{-0.025}$, a -0.3$\sigma$ shift from Union3. We then combine with measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) exactly as done by DESI DR2 and find $w_0=-0.719\pm0.084$, $w_a=-0.95^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, corresponding to 3.4$\sigma$ evidence against a cosmological constant (down from 3.8$\sigma$). We also update the DESI combined probe analysis using our correction to Pantheon+ and the recent DES-SN5YR Dovekie recalibration, finding $3.2\sigma$ (up from 2.8$\sigma$) and 3.4$\sigma$ (down from 4.2$\sigma$) evidence against a cosmological constant in the $w_0w_a$ plane, altogether marking a significantly improved consistency across SN analyses.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19424v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Low-frequency-selected Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxy Candidates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19525</link><description>arXiv:2601.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pilot study on the host galaxy environments of CHIME/FRBs by cross-matching baseband-localised events with the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz. Unlike traditional methods reliant on optical imaging, our radio-based selection allows for the identification of dust-obscured or optically faint star-forming galaxies. Of the 140 CHIME FRBs considered, 33 lie within the LoTSS DR2 footprint, and 16 show potential radio counterparts. Through multi-wavelength analysis, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and redshift constraints from the Macquart relation, we identify two secure and one tentative host candidates, all consistent with active star formation. However, their H$\alpha$-derived star formation rates appear underestimated, likely due to significant dust attenuation, as suggested by infrared colours and compact optical morphologies. Our results highlight the value of low-frequency radio data in complementing optical host searches and demonstrate the feasibility of host identification even in the absence of optical confirmation. With forthcoming data from LoTSS DR3 and the full CHIME/FRB baseband release, this method offers a promising path toward statistically robust studies of FRB host galaxies and their environments.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19525v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A Catalog of 971 FR-I Radio Galaxies from the FIRST Survey via Hybrid Deep Learning and Ridgeline Flux Density Distribution Analysis</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19609</link><description>arXiv:2601.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 971 FR-I radio galaxies (FR-Is) identified from the Very Large Array Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST) survey. The identifications were made using a hybrid method that combines deep learning with ridgeline flux density distribution analysis. Among these sources, 845 are new discoveries. The catalog comprises sources characterized by edge-darkened double jets, an absence of significant bent morphology, and angular sizes ranging from 23 to 159 arcseconds. Optical and/or infrared counterparts have been identified for 813 FR-Is. Among these, the host galaxies are predominantly (88.1\%) red galaxies, with the remainder (11.9\%) being blue galaxies; notably, most blue galaxies exhibit high radio power. The FR-I sample spans a radio power range of $1.20 \times 10^{21} \leq P_{\rm 1400} \leq 3.55 \times 10^{27} \, {\rm W\,Hz}^{-1}$ at 1400 MHz and reaches redshifts up to $z = 2.307$. The host galaxies have $r$-band absolute magnitudes in the range $-24 \lesssim M_r \lesssim -20$ mag. For the 512 FR-Is with estimates, the black hole masses fall within $10^7 \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 7.94 \times 10^9 \, M_{\odot}$. Based on optical emission-line ratios and mid-infrared colors, spectroscopic classification shows that 571 hosts are low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and 59 are high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs).</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19609v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Dynamical Evidence for a Billion Solar Mass Black Hole in Galaxy NGC 4061 from ALMA $^{12}$CO(2-1) Kinematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19842</link><description>arXiv:2601.19842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first robust dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the massive early-type galaxy NGC 4061 using high-spatial-resolution ALMA observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission. By combining archival Cycle 6 data with new Cycle 7 observations, we achieve a synthesized beam of $0''.16 \times 0''.13$, comparable to the expected sphere of influence of the central black hole. The molecular gas forms a regularly rotating circumnuclear disk aligned with the prominent dust lane seen in HST imaging. We model the full three-dimensional ALMA data cube using the KinMS forward-modeling framework, exploring both data-driven and analytic prescriptions for the gas surface brightness distribution. Our Bayesian analysis yields a best-fitting SMBH mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (1.17^{+0.08}_{-0.10}\,[{\rm stat.}] \pm 0.43\,[{\rm syst.}]) \times 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$ and an $I$-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of $M/L_{\rm F814W} = 3.46^{+0.07}_{-0.06}\,[{\rm stat.}] \pm 0.10\,[{\rm syst.}]$ M$_\odot$/L$_\odot$. The inferred black hole mass is fully consistent across different modeling assumptions and remains insensitive to plausible radial variations in the $M/L_{\rm F814W}$ profile. Our results resolve the long-standing discrepancy between previous indirect mass estimates based on conflicting stellar velocity dispersion measurements and demonstrate that the exceptionally large dispersion reported in the literature is likely spurious. This study highlights the power of high-resolution ALMA molecular gas kinematics for precision SMBH mass measurements at the high-mass end of the local black hole mass function.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.19842v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Reconstructing inflation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in light of ACT data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18958</link><description>arXiv:2601.18958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the inflationary epoch, we investigate the reconstruction of the background variables within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, considering the scalar spectral index $n_s(N)$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r(N)$, where $N$ denotes the number of $e-$folds. Under a general formalism, we determine the effective potential and the coupling function associated with the Gauss-Bonnet term as functions of the cosmological parameters $n_s(N)$ and $r(N)$, respectively. To implement the reconstruction methodology for the background variables, we study an example in which the attractors for the index $n_s$ and the ratio $r$ are in agreement with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. In this context, explicit expressions for the effective potential $V(\phi)$ and the coupling parameter $\xi(\phi)$ are reconstructed. Moreover, the reconstruction based on observational parameters shows that $V(\phi)\not\propto 1/\xi(\phi)$, in contrast to the assumption adopted in the literature for the study of the evolution of the universe in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18958v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Effect of Massive Trans-Neptunian Objects in the Long-term Evolution and Leaking Rates of Neptune's 3:2 and 2:1 Mean Motion Resonances</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03900</link><description>arXiv:2503.03900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current populations trapped in Neptune's main mean motion resonances in the Kuiper belt, Plutinos in the 3:2 and Twotinos in the 2:1, contain some of the best-characterized minor objects in the Solar System, given their dynamical importance. In particular, Twotinos may hide evidence of Neptune's early migration. However, these populations vary in time, declining at a rate that has not been previously clearly established. In this work, we use numerical simulations to study the long-term evolution of the Plutino and Twotino populations. We use two data sources: the most up-to-date observations and the theoretical debiased model of the Kuiper belt known as L7. In addition to studying the giant planets' effect on these populations over 4 Gyr, we analyze the additional impact produced by the ten most massive trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) trapped in these resonances, as well as the effect of Pluto on the 2:1 population. We find that the decay rate in each resonance can be modeled as a stochastic process well described by an exponential decay with an offset determined by an underlying long-term stable population. The most massive TNOs, particularly Pluto, influence this decay rate significantly, as expected for the 3:2 resonance. Remarkably, Pluto also strongly influences the 2:1 resonance's evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.03900v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A sudden dramatic change and recovery of magneto-environment of a repeating fast radio burst</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04727</link><description>arXiv:2503.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin. Some FRBs exhibit mild magneto-ionic environmental variations, possibly attributed to plasma turbulence or binary configuration. We report an abrupt magneto-ionic variation of FRB 20220529, a repeating FRB from a disk galaxy at redshift $0.1839 \pm 0.0001$. Initially, the Faraday rotation measure (RM) had a median of $17~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ and a scatter of $101~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ over 17 months. In December 2023, it jumped to $1977 \pm 84~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, and returned to typical values within two weeks. This drastic RM variation suggests that a dense magnetized clump enters and exits the line of sight in week timescales. One plausible scenario invokes a coronal mass ejection from a companion star, while other scenarios invoking extreme turbulence or binary orbital motion are also possible.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.04727v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Early solar wind and dynamo magnetic field topology predictions for (16) Psyche and other asteroids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17311</link><description>arXiv:2503.17311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asteroid (16) Psyche is a metal-rich body that might record an ancient coherent magnetization if some relict crust or mantle is preserved. Herein, we use magnetohydrodynamic simulations to predict (16) Psyche's field topology for several distinct pathways, (i) an early solar wind-induced magnetization imparted after a larger body was impacted, forming the present-day asteroid, (ii) a core dynamo magnetization imparted in an asteroid that is either presently largely intact or was a rubble pile, and (iii) magnetization in the turbulent solar nebula disk. For pathway (i) we find the field to be predominantly dipolar and spin axis-aligned. For pathway (ii) we find the field to be either dipolar and spin axis-misaligned, or highly multipolar. We also find that (iii) a field produced earlier before the solar nebula cleared, would be highly multipolar. In cases (i) and (ii) we also place constraints on the field strength. Simple detection of a magnetic field without constraining its topology and temporal variability would be insufficient to confirm a remanent source, due to the influence of the present-day solar wind, electromagnetic induction, and (16) Psyche's high obliquity. For sufficiently strong fields however, the field topology and orientation may reveal key observable consequences of the nature and history of (16) Psyche. Our framework is also broadly applicable to the study of magnetic fields from other asteroids.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.17311v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Black holes as telescopes: Discovering supermassive binaries through quasi-periodic lensed starlight</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16544</link><description>arXiv:2506.16544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary systems are unavoidable outcomes of galaxy mergers. Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the ``final parsec'' until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' -- regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral -- leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z&lt;0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.16544v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Correlation between H$\alpha$ emitters and their cosmic web environment at $z \sim 1$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23140</link><description>arXiv:2506.23140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy surveys will target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to test cosmological models. Deriving optimal constraints from emission-line galaxy clustering hinges on a robust understanding of their environmental dependence. Using the TNG300-1 simulation, we explore the correlation between properties of H$\alpha$ emitters and their environment anisotropy rather than traditional density-based measures. Our galactic H$\alpha$ emission model includes contributions from the warm interstellar medium. The environment anisotropy and type are assigned using a halo mass-dependent smoothing scale. We find that most luminous ELGs ($L_{\rm{H}\alpha}&gt;10^{42}\ \rm{erg\ s^{-1}}$) reside in filaments and knots. More generally, ELGs are more biased in strongly anisotropic environments. While correlations with galactic properties are found to be weak, they are statistically significant for host halo masses $M\lesssim 10^{12}\ M_\odot/h$. Our analysis motivates further investigation into how environmental anisotropy influences galaxy evolution, and highlights the potential for leveraging these effects in the analyses of upcoming cosmological surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.23140v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Tomographic constraints on the high-energy cosmic neutrino emission rate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14926</link><description>arXiv:2507.14926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing efforts to find the sources of high energy neutrinos measured by IceCube, the bulk of the neutrinos remain with unknown origins. We aim to constrain the emissivity of cosmic high-energy neutrinos from extragalactic sources through their correlation with the large-scale structure. We use cross-correlations between the IceCube 10-year dataset and tomographic maps of the galaxy overdensity to place constraints on the bias-weighted high-energy neutrino emissivity out to redshift $z\sim3$. We test two different models to describe the evolution of neutrino emissivity with redshift, a power law model $\propto (1+z)^a$, and a model tracking the star formation history, assuming a simple power law model for the energy injection spectrum. We also consider a non-parametric reconstruction of the astrophysical neutrino emissivity as a function of redshift. We do not find any significant correlation, with our strongest results corresponding to a $1.9 \sigma$ deviation with respect to a model with zero signal. We use our measurements to place upper bounds on the bias-weighted astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission rate as a function of redshift for different source models. This analysis provides a new probe to test extragalactic neutrino source models. With future neutrino and galaxy datasets we expect the constraining and detection power of this type of analysis analysis to increase.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.14926v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Hurst index of gamma-ray burst light curves and its statistical study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11631</link><description>arXiv:2509.11631v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) rank among the most powerful astrophysical phenomena, characterized by complex and highly variable prompt emission light curves that reflect the dynamics of their central engines. In this work, we analyze a sample of 163 long-duration GRBs detected by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE), applying detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to derive the Hurst index as a quantitative descriptor of temporal correlations in the light curves. We further explore statistical correlations between the Hurst index and 12 other observational parameters through regression and correlation analyses. Our results reveal anti-correlations between the Hurst index and the burst durations ($T_{50}$, $T_{90}$), and moderate positive correlations with peak photon flux proxies ($P_{pk1}$--$P_{pk3}$). By contrast, the standard spectral parameters (including the low-energy index $\alpha$) show no evidence for a linear dependence on the Hurst index in our sample. We do not find a clear monotonic weakening of the correlation strength from 64 ms to 1024 ms peak-flux measures; rather, the correlation coefficients for $P_{pk1}$--$P_{pk3}$ are comparable within uncertainties. The results offer new perspectives on the temporal structure of the GRB emission and its potential link to the underlying physical mechanisms driving these bursts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.11631v4</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The MATISSE view of the inner region of the RY Tau protoplanetary disk</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08309</link><description>arXiv:2511.08309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The T-Tauri type young stellar object RY Tau exhibits a dust depleted inner cavity characteristic of a transition disk. We constrain the spatial distribution and mineralogy of dust in the RY Tau protoplanetary disk in the inner few astronomical units using spectrally resolved interferometric observations in the L, M, and N bands obtained with VLTI/MATISSE.
  Employing a 2D temperature gradient model we estimate the orientation of the inner disk finding no evidence of significant misalignment between the inner and outer disk of RY Tau. Successively, we analyze the chemical composition of silicates depending on spatial region in the disk and identify several silicate species commonly found in protoplanetary disks. Additionally, a depletion of amorphous dust grains toward the central protostar is observed. Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations show that hot dust close to the protostar and in the line of sight to the observer, either in the uppermost disk layers of a strongly flared disk or in a dusty envelope, is necessary to model the observations. The shadow cast by a dense innermost disk midplane on the dust further out explains the observed closure phases in the L band and to some extent in the M band. However, the closure phases in the N band are underestimated by our model, hinting at an additional asymmetry in the flux density distribution not visible at shorter wavelengths.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.08309v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Adsorption of volatiles on dust grains in protoplanetary disks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09481</link><description>arXiv:2511.09481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adsorption of volatile molecules onto dust grain surfaces fundamentally influences dust-related processes, including condensation of gas-phase molecules, dust coagulation, and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Using advanced ab-initio density functional theory with r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 van der Waals functionals, we calculate adsorption energies of H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO on carbonaceous (graphene, amorphous carbon) and silicate (MgSiO$_3$) surfaces. Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.1-0.2~{\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.5-1.5~{\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.09481v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Pulsed radio emission from a Central Compact Object</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17214</link><description>arXiv:2512.17214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.17214v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Constraining the neutron star-black hole merger rate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09773</link><description>arXiv:2503.09773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current template-based gravitational-wave searches for compact binary mergers neglect the general relativistic phenomenon of spin-induced orbital precession. Owing to their asymmetric masses, gravitational-waves from neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries are prime candidates for displaying strong imprints of spin-precession. Current searches may therefore miss a significant fraction of the astrophysical population, and the detected NSBH population may be significantly suppressed or biased. Here we report the most sensitive search for NSBH binaries to date by including spin-precession for the first time. We analyze data from the entirety of the third LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA gravitational-wave observing run and show that when accounting for spin-precession, our search is up to 100% more sensitive than the search techniques currently adopted by the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA collaboration (for systems with strong precessional effects). This allows us to more tightly constrain the rate of NSBH mergers in the local Universe. When focusing on a potentially precessing subpopulation of NSBH mergers, the lack of observed candidates allows us to place an upper limit on the merger rate of $R_{90} = 79\, \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ with 90% confidence. We then show that if there is no preferred direction of component spin, the overall rate of NSBH mergers is on average 16% smaller than previously believed. Finally, we report four new subthreshold NSBH candidates, all with strong imprints of spin precession, but note that these are most likely to be of terrestrial origin.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.09773v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Identification and Denoising of Radio Signals from Cosmic-Ray Air Showers using Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14711</link><description>arXiv:2508.14711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio pulses generated by cosmic-ray air showers can be used to reconstruct key properties like the energy and depth of the electromagnetic component of cosmic-ray air showers. Radio detection threshold, influenced by natural and anthropogenic radio background, can be reduced through various techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an effective way to lower the threshold. We developed two CNNs: a classifier to distinguish radio signal waveforms from background noise and a denoiser to clean contaminated radio signals. Following the training and testing phases, we applied the networks to air-shower data triggered by scintillation detectors of the prototype station for the enhancement of IceTop, IceCube's surface array at the South Pole. Over a four-month period, we identified 554 cosmic-ray events in coincidence with IceTop, approximately five times more compared to a reference method based on a cut on the signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with IceTop measurements of the same air showers confirmed that the CNNs reliably identified cosmic-ray radio pulses and outperformed the reference method. Additionally, we find that CNNs reduce the false-positive rate of air-shower candidates and effectively denoise radio waveforms, thereby improving the accuracy of the power and arrival time reconstruction of radio pulses.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14711v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Two Epochs of VLBI Observations of Eight KISSR Seyfert and LINER Galaxies: Suggestions of Fast and Filamentary Outflows</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae22cf</link><description>We present here the results from a second epoch of phase-referenced VLBA observations of eight Seyfert and LINER galaxies from the KISSR sample. These sources were chosen based on the presence of double peaks or asymmetries in their emission lines as observed in SDSS spectra. Parsec-scale radio emission is detected in seven of the eight sources in the second epoch. Jet-like features appear to persist over a ∼4–9 yr timeline in these “radio-quiet” AGN. A few sources like KISSR1494, however, show significantly different structures after a 9 yr interval. KISSR102, which was previously suggested to be a binary black hole candidate based on the presence of two compact cores, shows the tentative signatures of superluminal jet motion (1.05 ± 0.45c). Tentative superluminal motion in a jet knot has been reported in another source, KISSR872 (1.65 ± 0.57c). We present 1.5 GHz images from the VLA A-array of four sources. These images reveal core-lobe or core-halo structures. The alignment of the VLBI jet direction with the kiloparsec-scale spectral index gradient, as well as the mismatch between the star formation rate derived from the radio and Hα line emission, support the suggestion that the kiloparsec-scale emission is AGN-jet-related. The jets in KISSR sources appear to lose collimation over spatial scales between 200 pc and 1 kpc. Overall, the characteristics of the KISSR jets are reminiscent of similar properties observed in VLBI monitoring studies of “radio-loud” AGN jets even as subtle differences related to the compactness and brightness of jet features remain.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae22cf</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Multicolor Characterization of Optically Invisible FU Orionis-type Outbursts: Demonstration and Prospects for the WINTER Survey</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2322</link><description>Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the protostellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on (i) their proximity to star-forming regions, (ii) large amplitude (2–4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, (iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and (iv) “mixed-temperature” infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor that we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits ≳100× fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object outbursts. We highlight the capabilities of the Galactic Plane Survey of the recently commissioned WINTER observatory in addressing the poorly understood FUor population with its unique combination of real-time detection capabilities, multicolor sensitivity, weekly cadence, and wide area coverage.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2322</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] First Mid-infrared Detection and Modeling of a Flare from Sgr A*. II. Mid-infrared Spectral Energy Distribution and Millimeter Polarimetry</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25ef</link><description>S. D. von Fellenberg et al. reported the first mid-infrared detection of a flare from Sgr A*. The JWST/MIRI/Medium Resolution Spectrometer observations were consistent with an orbiting hotspot undergoing electron injection with a spectrum that subsequently breaks from synchrotron cooling. However, mid-infrared extinction measurements appropriate for these data were not yet determined, and, therefore, the temporal evolution of the absolute spectral index remained unknown. This work applies new Sgr A* extinction measurements to the flare observations. The evolution of the spectral index after the peak is fully consistent with that reported in Paper I with a maximum absolute mid-infrared spectral index αMIR = 0.45 ± 0.01stat ± 0.08sys during the second mid-infrared flare peak, matching the known near-infrared spectral index during bright states (αNIR ≈ 0.5). There was a near-instantaneous change in the mid-infrared spectral index of ΔαMIR = 0.33 ± 0.06stat ± 0.11sys at the flare onset. We propose this as a quantitative definition for this infrared flare’s beginning, physically interpreted as the underlying electron distribution’s transition into a hard power-law distribution. This paper also reports the Submillimeter Array millimeter polarization during the flare, which shows a small, distorted, but overall CW-oriented Stokes Q–U loop during the third mid-infrared peak. Extrapolating the mid-infrared flux power law to the millimeter yields a variable flux consistent with the observed 220 GHz emission. These results, together with the Paper I modeling, plausibly suggest a single hotspot produced both the mid-infrared and millimeter variability during this event. However, additional flares are required to make a general statement about the millimeter and mid-infrared connection.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25ef</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] EIGER.

The Evolving Relationship between Galaxies and the Intergalactic Medium in the Final Stages of Reionization</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2799</link><description>We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the late stages of cosmic reionization, based on the complete JWST EIGER dataset. Using deep NIRCam 3.5 μm slitless spectroscopy, we construct a sample of 948 [O iii]λ5008-emitting galaxies with −21.4 ≲ MUV ≲ −17.2 spanning 5.33 &lt; z &lt; 6.97 along six quasar sight lines. We correlate these galaxies with Lyα and Lyβ transmission measured from high-resolution quasar spectra across multiple redshift intervals. We find clear redshift evolution in the correlation between galaxy density and transmission: it is suppressed in overdense regions at z &lt; 5.50, while enhanced at 5.70 &lt; z &lt; 6.15. The intermediate range exhibits a transitional behavior. Cross-correlation measurements further reveal excess absorption within ∼8 cMpc of galaxies at low redshifts, and enhanced transmission at intermediate scales (∼5–20 cMpc) at z &gt; 5.70. Statistical tests using mock catalogs with realistic galaxy clustering but no correlation with the transmission field confirm that the observed correlations are unlikely to arise by chance. The evolving signals can be explained by stronger absorption in overdense regions, combined with the competing influences of local radiation fields and the rising background radiation. While local radiation dominates ionization of the surrounding IGM at earlier times, the background becomes increasingly important, eventually surpassing the impact of nearby galaxies. These results support an inside-out progression of reionization, with ionized regions originating around clustered, star-forming galaxies and gradually extending into underdense regions.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2799</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Historical Reconstruction of Solar Surface Magnetism from Cycles 1–24 Using the Synthetic Active Region Generator and the Advective Flux Transport Model</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae279a</link><description>The historical reconstruction of the Sun’s surface magnetic field remains a persistent challenge, limiting our ability to investigate the long-term global properties of the Sun, including the evolution of the large-scale magnetic field, solar cycle prediction, reconstruction of total solar irradiance, and secular solar variability. In this study, we employ the Advective Flux Transport (AFT) model in conjunction with our newly developed Synthetic Active Region Generator (SARG) to construct a catalog of synthetic active regions (ARs) spanning solar cycles 1–24 (1755–2020). We use the SIDC/SILSO sunspot number version 2.0 as the sole input governing the properties of the synthetic ARs in this catalog. This SARG catalog is then incorporated into the AFT model, which simulates the emergence of new ARs on the Sun, which are then transported under the influence of surface flows to produce maps of the full-Sun radial photospheric magnetic field over the entire 265 yr period. We modulate the AR tilt for each cycle in order to ensure that the polar fields are consistent with the solar cycle amplitudes. We find that the polar fields derived from these simulations exhibit excellent correlation (r &gt; 0.8) with observational proxies, including polar faculae counts and Ca ii K polar network indices. Daily synchronic maps from these simulations for the entire 265 yr period are made publicly available to support a wide range of applications beyond those presented in this work.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae279a</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] HST Confirms Sub-5 kpc Dual Quasar Pairs at Cosmic Noon</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2f63</link><description>During cosmic noon (z ∼ 1–3), when both star formation and black hole growth peaked, galaxy mergers are predicted to trigger dual active galactic nuclei that eventually coalesce as supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries. However, observations of dual quasars with sub-5 kpc separations—the critical phase preceding final coalescence—have remained challenging due to angular resolution limitations. We present the discovery and confirmation of two subarcsecond dual quasars at z &gt; 1, selected from 59,025 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars, which fall within the footprint of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey. Using high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging and slitless spectroscopy, we confirmed SDSS J1625+4309 (z = 1.647, separation 0 55/4.7 kpc) and SDSS J0229−0514 (z = 3.174, separation 0 42/3.2 kpc), probing the sub-5 kpc separation regime. Through the novel combination of WFC3/IR direct imaging (F140W) and grism spectroscopy (G141), we resolve both components morphologically and spectroscopically confirm their dual nature via detection of Hβ+[O iii] and Mg ii emission lines in each nucleus. Two-dimensional image decomposition reveals distinct host galaxy morphologies: J1625+4309 shows an extended, disturbed structure (Re = 4.7 kpc) indicative of an ongoing major merger, while J0229−0514 exhibits a compact host (Re = 1.4 kpc) suggesting an advanced coalescence stage. Black hole mass estimates based on virial relations yield with line-of-sight velocity offsets of (0.7 ± 0.1) × 103 km s−1 and (1.0 ± 0.2) × 103 km s−1, respectively. These confirmations directly constrain the frequency and properties of close dual quasars, opening new avenues for studying SMBH mergers at cosmic noon.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2f63</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Radio Counterparts of Ultraluminous X-Ray Sources in Nearby Galaxies</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae31e4</link><description>Radio surveys of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) allow us to find supercritically accreting compact objects (SS 433/W50-like systems) or stripped nuclear black holes in nearby galaxies. We identified 21 such objects by crossmatching a ULX catalog with the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey and Very Large Array Sky Survey. They may have a diverse population. (i) Three have a double-lobed radio structure with a compact core found in two of them and could be quasars. (ii) Five associated with an extended radio structure reside in star-forming regions, and their radio emission is likely due to star-forming activities. Two of them show X-ray variability suggesting that they are ULXs embedded in star-forming regions. (iii) Thirteen are associated with an unresolved radio source, with a steep spectrum seen in eight and a flat or inverted spectrum seen in two. Those with a steep spectrum are arguably candidates for SS 433/W50-like objects, with radio emission due to optically thin synchrotron radiation in a surrounding jet/wind powered nebula. Remarkable cases include NGC 925 ULX 1 and NGC 6946 ULX 1, which are associated with an optical nebula. Those with a flat or inverted spectrum could be accreting black holes with a compact jet, while the black hole mass is estimated to be several 106–108M⊙ based on the fundamental plane. Redshift measurements are needed to firmly determine the association with their apparent host galaxy.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae31e4</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Analysis of Solar Surface Oscillations and Energy Transport with Bispectral Electronic Thermostatistics</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25ec</link><description>The ubiquitous 5 minute solar p-mode oscillations, excited at the photosphere, play a crucial role in driving various coronal instabilities and mediating upward energy transport. These modes are strongly influenced by nonthermal electron populations. To investigate this, we employ a double-spectral electronic thermostatistical framework—the generalized (r, q)-distribution—to analyze the oscillation dynamics, growth behavior, and mechanical energy transport properties of longitudinal helioseismic modes at the photosphere. A local linear perturbative analysis, applied to inhomogeneous, viscous, turbulent, and nonthermal solar plasmas, yields a cubic eigenmode equation (dispersion relation) capturing diverse signatures of collective global modes. We examine the influence of nonthermality indices, electron temperature, and ion dynamic viscosity on dispersion and mode stability. Numerical analysis of the coupled dynamics of low-energy (thermal) and high-energy (suprathermal) electrons reveals their significant impact on solar surface oscillations. Notably, the nonthermality spectral indices r and q play mode-accelerating roles, counteracting damping from temperature and viscosity. Our results suggest that the high-frequency (short-period) p-modes can carry energy fluxes exceeding 106 W m−2 near the lower photosphere—energizing the chromosphere and quiet corona—thereby potentially influencing the excitation of spicules, microspicules, and coronal loop oscillations. In contrast, the low-frequency (long-period) g-modes have no such active influences on coronal heating. A hybrid power-law decay formalism is developed to model the attenuation of p-mode energy flux with height and is quantitatively fitted to Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Doppler velocity observations. Complementary 2D simulations further elucidate the spatiotemporal evolution of vertical energy flux, shaped by the nonthermal electron distribution.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25ec</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] INTEGRAL IBIS Catalog of Magnetar Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2d17</link><description>One of the distinctive properties of magnetars, young neutron stars powered mainly by magnetic energy, is the emission of short (≲1 s) bursts of hard X-rays. Such bursts have been observed in nearly all the known magnetars, although at different and time-variable rates of occurrence. In the past two decades, the INTEGRAL satellite has extensively covered the Galactic plane with good imaging capabilities, where most magnetars reside. We present the results of a comprehensive search for magnetar bursts in more than 20 yr of archival data of the INTEGRAL IBIS instrument (15 keV–1 MeV). This led to the detection of 1349 bursts with 30–150 keV fluence in the ∼2 × 10−9 to 3 × 10−6 erg cm−2 range from 21 of the 34 examined magnetars and candidate magnetars with well-known positions. The durations of the bursts, in terms of T90, follow a lognormal distribution centered at ∼0.1 s. Most of the detected bursts originated from three particularly active sources: 1E 1547–5408, SGR 1806–20, and SGR 1935+2154. The integral distributions of their burst fluences follow power laws with slopes β = 0.76±0.04, 0.95±0.06, and 0.92±0.10, respectively. The burst spectra are generally well fit with an exponentially cutoff power law with peak energy Epeak in the range ∼20−60 keV for SGR 1806–20 and SGR 1935+2154, while the bursts of 1E 1547–5408 are slightly harder (Epeak ∼ 35−100 keV). A significant anticorrelation between Epeak and fluence is found for SGR 1806–20, which provided the largest number of bursts among the sources of our sample.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2d17</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Cosm] Probing boson clouds with supermassive black hole binaries</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/055</link><description>Rotating black holes can generate boson clouds via superradiance when the boson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole's size. In binary systems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent studies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest that if the binary forms at a large separation, resonant transitions can significantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences except for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this framework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the influence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before entering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy loss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes hyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of the cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the ionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these theoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs can be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining changes in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and variations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a complex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass, emphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in detecting boson clouds within binaries.</description><author>Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/055</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Cosm] Probing regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature through periodic orbits and their gravitational wave radiation</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/059</link><description>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are among the key targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. The gravitational waveforms emitted by EMRIs are highly sensitive to the orbital dynamics of the small compact object, which in turn are determined by the geometry of the underlying spacetime. In this paper, we explore the detectability of regular black holes with sub-Planckian curvature, which can be interpreted as regularized versions of the Schwarzschild black hole (RSBH). To do so, we begin by analyzing the metric and geodesics, determining the effective potential, and investigating the marginally bound orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits for timelike particles. Our analysis reveals that orbital radius, angular momentum, and energy significantly depend on the model parameter α for both orbits. In addition, we study how variations in α influence the photon sphere and the corresponding shadow silhouette. Observations of M87* and Sgr A* motivate testing whether α falls within an observationally constrained range, narrower than the theoretical bound ensuring a singularity-free BH structure. Our main aim is to focus on the influence of the model parameter on a specific kind of orbit, the periodic orbit, surrounding a supermassive RSBH. The findings show that, for a constant rational integer, α has a significant impact on the energy and angular momentum of the periodic orbit. Utilising the numerical kludge method, we further investigate the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial body over various periodic orbits. The waveforms display discrete zoom and spin phases within a complete orbital period, influenced by the RSBH parameter α. As the system evolves, the phase shift in the gravitational waveforms grows progressively more pronounced, with cumulative deviations amplifying over time. With the ongoing advancements in space-based gravitational wave detection systems, our results will aid in leveraging EMRIs to probe and characterize the RSBH properties.</description><author>Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/059</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Cosm] Constraints on extra charges in dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole from the observations of quasi-periodic oscillations</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/060</link><description>This paper investigates the influence of the dimensionless electric charge (Q/M), magnetic charge (P/M), and Taub-NUT parameter (n/M) of a dyonic Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Taub-NUT black hole on quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in X-ray binaries. Using the relativistic precession model, we calculate the three fundamental frequencies arising from particle motion in the accretion disk around the black hole. These theoretical predictions are then confronted with observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries (GRO J1655–40, XTE J1859+226, XTE J1550–564, GRS 1915+105, and H1743–322), and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique is used to constrain the black hole parameters. Our analysis reveals no significant evidence for nonzero values of Q/M and P/M across all sources, thereby allowing us to place several stringent upper limits on electric charge (Q/M) and magnetic charge (P/M) of the black hole in these systems. Similarly, no compelling indication of a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter is found in QPOs from GRO J1655–40, XTE J1859+226, XTE J1550–564, and H1743–322. In contrast, the posterior distribution derived from GRS 1915+105 data suggests a nonzero Taub-NUT parameter, i.e., gravitomagnetic monopole moment. This result indicates a potential deviation from the Kerr metric in this astrophysical black hole.</description><author>Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/060</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Cosm] Inflationary dynamics of non-minimally coupled f(R) matter-curvature theories</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/061</link><description>This study examines how inflationary dynamics are affected by f(R)-theories with a non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. Both positive and negative corrections to the minimal coupling of General Relativity are considered, and a robust numerical method is developed that evolves the metric and the inflaton field in this modified theory beyond slow-roll. Through a stability analysis, we find that positive models are inherently unstable during slow-roll, whereas negative ones can accommodate a stable attractor de Sitter solution. Using the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum from the latest data releases, we constrain the scale of the non-minimal coupling to be above 1013 GeV. In light of the 2018 Planck, BICEP/Keck and the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope data for the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio, strong constraints on the coupling strength force the effects of these modified theories to be, at most, slightly above the perturbative level. Furthermore, we determine that the choice of the perfect fluid matter Lagrangian does not impact the inflationary observables at the pivot scale. Finally, we present the predicted observables for different inflationary potentials and show that even though classical gravity is still preferred by the data, there are areas of the parameter space that are viable for non-minimally coupled inflationary models.</description><author>Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/061</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] A Common Synchrotron Origin for Prompt Gamma-Ray and Soft X-Ray Emission in Gamma-Ray Bursts: Evidence from Joint Spectral Analysis</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2743</link><description>The recent launches of the Einstein Probe and the Space Variable Objects Monitor mission have led to the detection of a growing number of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with significant, early soft X-ray flux during their gamma-ray emission, prompting the question of whether their multiband prompt emission shares a common origin in region and mechanism. To address this, we utilize the 20-year Swift archival data, which provides a substantial sample of joint soft X-ray and gamma-ray observations, enabling a systematic joint spectral study. We resolve 110 temporal pulses from 46 GRBs and find that a single power-law model with a low-energy break or cutoff adequately describes the prompt spectra from 150 keV down to 0.5 keV. More than half of the sample pulses require a break around a few keV, with average spectral indices 〈α1〉 = −0.88 and 〈α2〉 = −1.46 consistent with synchrotron radiation in a marginally fast-cooling regime. The observed spectral evolution and the distribution of indices support a single-emission-region origin, where the varying spectral shapes are largely governed by the evolution of the synchrotron cooling frequency νc and the effect of finite emission width. The observed differences in the temporal behavior between X-ray and gamma-ray light curves can be naturally explained by this spectral evolution across the broad band.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2743</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles] Burgers equation for the bulk viscous pressure of quark matter</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/3v42-8dpw</link><description>Author(s): José Luis Hernández, Cristina Manuel, Saga Säppi, and Laura Tolos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dissipative properties of relativistic strongly interacting nuclear matter significantly influence the damping of stellar oscillations and density fluctuations during compact star mergers.

Abstract: Aims. We aim to investigate the connection between star formation histories (SFHs) and the inner dark matter density profiles of simulated galaxies. In particular, we test whether the burstiness and temporal distribution of star formation influence the formation of cored versus cuspy dark matter profiles. Methods. We homogeneously analysed simulated galaxies from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 projects. For each galaxy, we derived dark matter density profiles and measured the logarithmic slope in the inner region of the dark matter halo (1-2% of R$_{\rm vir}$). To characterise star formation burstiness, we introduced a criterion based on comparing the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over two distinct timescales. We further quantified the duration of SFHs by computing $M_{\star, \rm post}$ / $M_{\star, \rm pre}$, the ratio of stellar mass formed after versus before the epoch of reionisation at redshift z $\sim$ 6.5. Results. Homogeneous analysis reveals that inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio trends for NIHAO and FIRE-2 galaxies are in much better agreement than reported in previous works. The burstiness and duration of the SFH explain the scatter in the inner slope versus stellar-to-halo mass ratio relation, revealing that galaxies with above average burstiness and more extended SFHs are more efficient at developing cored dark matter profiles. In contrast, galaxies with smoother SFHs and earlier stellar mass assembly tend to maintain cuspier dark matter profiles. We present an analytic expression that improves predictions for the inner slope using the parameter $M_{\star \rm,post}$ / $M_{\star \rm,pre}$, which reduces the mean squared error in both simulation suites relative to previous formulations based solely on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17113v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Improving Generalization and Uncertainty Quantification of Photometric Redshift Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17222</link><description>arXiv:2601.17222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate redshift estimates are a vital component in understanding galaxy evolution and precision cosmology. In this paper, we explore approaches to increase the applicability of machine learning models for photometric redshift estimation on a broader range of galaxy types. Typical models are trained with ground-truth redshifts from spectroscopy. We test the utility and effectiveness of two approaches for combining spectroscopic redshifts and redshifts derived from multiband ($\sim$35 filters) photometry, which sample different types of galaxies compared to spectroscopic surveys. The two approaches are (1) training on a composite dataset and (2) transfer learning from one dataset to another. We compile photometric redshifts from the COSMOS2020 catalog (TransferZ) to complement an established spectroscopic redshift dataset (GalaxiesML). We used two architectures, deterministic neural networks (NN) and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), to examine and evaluate their performance with respect to the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) photo-$z$ science requirements. We also use split conformal prediction for calibrating uncertainty estimates and producing prediction intervals for the BNN and NN, respectively. We find that a NN trained on a composite dataset predicts photo-$z$'s that are 4.5 times less biased within the redshift range $0.3&lt;1.5$, 1.1 times less scattered, and has a 1.4 times lower outlier rate than a model trained on only spectroscopic ground truths. We also find that BNNs produce reliable uncertainty estimates, but are sensitive to the different ground truths. This investigation leverages different sources of ground truths to develop models that can accurately predict photo-$z$'s for a broader population of galaxies crucial for surveys such as Euclid and LSST.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17222v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The rest ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distributions of heavily reddened quasars are "V-shaped" and hot-dust poor</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17416</link><description>arXiv:2601.17416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rest-ultraviolet to infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis of 63 heavily reddened quasars (HRQs) at redshifts z=0.7-2.7 and with dust extinctions E(B-V)=0.4-1.8. Our analysis demonstrates that SEDs with red optical and blue UV continua are very common in HRQs, with more than 82 per cent of the sample showing a UV-excess relative to the reddened quasar continuum. We model the SEDs by combining a reddened quasar and an unobscured scattered light component, though contributions from a star-forming host galaxy cannot be ruled out. The average scattering fraction is small (0.3 per cent). Higher scattering fractions are ruled out by the (i-K)=2.5 colour-cut used to select HRQs which pre-dates the discovery of the JWST "Little Red Dot" (LRD) population. Hence, LRDs generally have bluer UV continua. Nevertheless, four HRQs satisfy the LRD UV/optical continuum slope selections and are therefore massive, cosmic noon analogues of LRDs. Analysis of the near-infrared SEDs of HRQs reveals a deficit of hot dust relative to blue quasars, similar to what is observed in LRDs. This suggests HRQs trace a phase where strong AGN feedback processes eject dust from the inner torus. The UV scattering fraction of HRQs is weakly correlated with the amount of hot dust emission and anti-correlated with the line-of-sight extinction, E(B-V). This is consistent with the hot dust acting as the scattering medium, and the line-of-sight extinction being dominated by dust on interstellar medium scales in the host galaxy.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17416v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Tracing Galaxy Evolution in the Nearby Universe: The Role of Dark Matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17610</link><description>arXiv:2601.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a sample of $\sim$126,000 late-type galaxies (LTGs) from SDSS, we analyzed stellar mass as a function of dynamical mass. Stellar masses were estimated using eight SPS models with constant IMFs, while dynamical masses were derived from seven formulations based on Newtonian dynamics and virial equilibrium, incorporating both stellar and gas velocity dispersions. We account for key factors affecting dynamical mass estimation, including inclination, colour, concentration, and S\'ersic index. We find that the difference between dynamical and stellar mass ($\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$) ranges from nearly zero to $\sim$95% of the dynamical mass, depending on mass and redshift. $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$ appears to decreases with increasing redshift, but exhibits a saddle-like shape at low mass and low redshift-especially in disk-dominated LTGs-transitioning into a steep, linear trend at higher masses and redshifts. In the high-mass regime, the behavior resembles that of early-type galaxies. Moreover, our results indicate that this evolution is not discrete but follows a continuous transition between morphological regimes. Dark matter within LTGs is at most equal to $\Delta \log \mathbf{M}$, depending on the impact of the IMF and SPS on stellar mass estimation. Although SPS-based stellar masses do not include the gas component, previous studies have shown that galaxies with log($\mathbf{M_{Stellar}/M_{Solar}}) &gt; 10$ at $z \leq 0.3$ are predominantly stellar-mass dominated. Most galaxies in our sample fall within this regime, minimizing the impact of gas exclusion. Our findings go beyond the scope of single galaxies, providing insight into the nearby Universe and highlighting the influence of dark matter in determining the Universe's structure and evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17610v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Energy shift of Fe-K fluorescence lines due to low ionization demonstrated with XRISM in Centaurus X-3</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17792</link><description>arXiv:2601.17792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line at 6.4 keV is a powerful probe of cold matter surrounding X-ray sources and has been widely used in various astrophysical contexts. The X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM can measure line shifts with unprecedented precision of $\sim$0.2 eV, equivalent to a line-of-sight velocity of $\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. At this level of accuracy, however, several factors that influence the line energy must be carefully considered prior to astrophysical interpretation. One such important factor is the ionization degree, Fe$^{q+}$. The K$\alpha$ line shifts redward by $\sim$4 eV as $q$ increases from 0 (neutral) to 8 (Ar-like). Additionally, the accompanying Fe K$\beta$ line at 7.06 keV shifts blueward by $\sim$30 eV from $q=0$ to 8. We demonstrate that this effect is actually observable in the XRISM data of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3 (Cen X-3). We advocate that the differential energy shift between the K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ line provides a robust estimate of $q$ by decoupling from other effects that shift the two lines in the same direction. We derived $q \sim 5$ (Sc-like) for the fluorescing matter by comparing the observation with atomic structure calculations of our own and in the literature. By accounting for the derived charge state and the corresponding shift in the rest-frame line energy, we made corrections for this effect and reached a consistent residual shift among the K$\alpha$, K$\beta$, and the optical measurement attributable to the systemic velocity of the system. Consequently, we obtained a new constraint on the location of the cold matter. This ionization effect needs to be assessed in all use cases of the Fe K$\alpha$ line shift beyond Cen X-3, and the proposed metric is generally applicable to all of them.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17792v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Joint constraint on the propagation origin of the cosmic-ray spectral knee from energy spectrum and anisotropy observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17851</link><description>arXiv:2601.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin mechanism of the cosmic-ray knee region remains an unresolved mystery, with acceleration, interaction, and propagation models drawing significant attention. The latest experimental observations of the PeV total spectrum, composition energy spectrum, and anisotropy-particularly the precise measurements of the proton spectrum by the LHAASO experiment-have provided crucial breakthroughs in uncovering its origin. Based on the latest LHAASO measurements of the proton energy spectrum, combined with cosmic-ray spectral and anisotropy data, this study proposes that the spectral index variation in the knee region arises from changes in the propagation coefficient. By introducing a knee position $\rm \mathcal{R}_{knee}$ and an index variation $\rm \delta_{knee}$, we construct a rigidity-dependent double-power-law diffusion model to reproduce the knee-region spectral structure. Through modifications to the diffusion coefficient, we successfully replicate the observed knee-region spectral structure in the LHAASO proton spectrum and calculate the corresponding anisotropy. Under current data and model dependencies, a joint analysis of the energy spectrum and anisotropy does not support the propagation origin model of the cosmic-ray knee at a 95\% confidence level. We hope that future LHAASO experiments will provide precise measurements of the energy spectra and anisotropies of various nuclei in the knee region, thereby offering a definitive test of the propagation model as the origin mechanism of the knee-region spectral structure.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.17851v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Neutrino opacities in magnetic fields for binary neutron star merger simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18051</link><description>arXiv:2601.18051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino interactions play a central role in transport and flavor evolution in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. Simulations suggest that neutron star mergers may produce magnetic fields as strong as $10^{17}$ G, but computational difficulties have hampered the inclusion of magnetic field effects in neutrino interaction rates. In this paper we give approximate interaction rates for neutrinos in the presence of strong magnetic fields, including the effects of Landau quantization and anomalous magnetic moments with errors of order $\sqrt{T/M}$. We also comment on a neutrino production channel from individual neutrons that can produce low-energy $\nu \bar{\nu}$ pairs even at low density.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18051v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Dynamical Mass Loss at the End of TP-AGB stars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18194</link><description>arXiv:2601.18194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase plays a key role in the evolution of low- to intermediate-mass stars, driving mass loss that influences their final stages and contributes to galactic chemical enrichment. However, the mechanisms behind mass loss, particularly at the end of AGB, are still not well understood. We aim to investigate the relationship between stellar parameters and envelope dynamics during the TP-AGB phase, evaluating whether dynamical instabilities in the envelope can act as a possible mass-loss mechanism. We use hydrodynamics method in MESA to simulate the dynamical pulsations and resulting mass loss during the TP-AGB phase of a star evolved from a 1.5 Msun zero-age main sequence. Our simulations reproduce the dynamical pulsation behavior of stars during the TP-AGB phase, demonstrating that the envelope mass is a key factor governing pulsational properties. As the envelope mass decreases, both the pulsation period and radial amplitude increase, consistent with observational trends. For 1.5 Msun model, once the envelope mass declines to approximately 0.25 Msun, the model enters a regime of violent pulsations, potentially ejecting the remaining envelope within a few hundred years. We suggest that the instability can act as the dominant mass-loss mechanism in the end of the TP-AGB phase, marking a rapid transitional stage toward the post-AGB phase.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18194v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Revisiting a Quasar Microlensing Event Towards AGN~J1249+3449</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18262</link><description>arXiv:2601.18262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.} %MDPI: Please confirm if the bold formatting is necessary; if not, please remove it.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18262v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Galactic Large-scale Filaments Resident in Asymmetric Environments: Clues from Cross-filament Profiles of Density and Temperature</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18485</link><description>arXiv:2601.18485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale filaments ubiquitously exist in the Galactic interstellar medium, and their radial profiles offer insights into their formation mechanisms. We present a statistical analysis of molecular hydrogen column density ($\rm N(H_2)$) and dust temperature ($\rm T_d$) radial profiles for 35 Galactic large-scale filaments. We divided their spines into 315 segments, extracted the radial profiles of each segment using $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ maps derived from $Herschel$ Hi-GAL data, and estimated the asymmetry degree within the radial profiles ($\alpha_{\rm asy}$), as well as the length proportion of segments with asymmetric profiles across the entire filament ($f_{\rm asy}$). We found that Galactic large-scale filaments reside in surroundings distinctly asymmetric and varied in $\rm N(H_2)$, and mild asymmetric yet stable in $\rm T_d$. Different filament morphology types do not show significant differences in $\alpha_{\rm asy}$ or $f_{\rm asy}$. A bent filament shape does not necessarily correspond to an asymmetric radial profile, whereas a straight filament shape may be associated with a symmetric profile. Segments with asymmetric surroundings in $\rm N(H_2)$ may not simultaneously appear asymmetric in $\rm T_d$, and vice versa. We found three filaments with 4-44% of their spine show asymmetric $\rm N(H_2)$ and $\rm T_d$ radial profiles in inverse trends, likely caused by nearby HII region. HII regions of similar scale to large filaments can induce asymmetric radial profiles within them, indicating their influence on filament evolution. However, they are unlikely to independently trigger the formation of an entire Galactic large-scale filament, in contrast to their role in small-scale filament formation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18485v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Multi-epoch VLBI observations of the blazar 3C 66A: Spatial twisting and temporal oscillation of the parsec-scale jet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18551</link><description>arXiv:2601.18551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous VLBI kinematic studies of the blazar 3C 66A have unveiled complex jet kinematic behaviors. Using follow-up high-resolution VLBI observations and archival data, we investigate the morphology and the variations in orientation and core flux density of the 3C 66A jet to gain a deeper insights into its kinematic behavior and physical origins. We performed KVN and VERA array (KaVA) observations at 22/43 GHz over three epochs in 2014 and collected 109 sets of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) archival data at 43 GHz between 1996 - 2025. We imaged the parsec-scale jet and parameterized it using circular Gaussian fittings to the UV visibilities. Finally, we derived the inner jet PA and the core flux densities for the VLBA data. The jet presents a twisted morphology in the KaVA maps. The PA of the fitted Gaussian components is in the range between 170 deg and 195 deg. Our kinematic analysis using the VLBA data indicates that the PA oscillates with an amplitude of 7.77 pm 0.79 deg and a period of 10.94 pm 0.22 years, presented for the first time in this work. This oscillation is topped by a continuous clockwise shift of the PA by -0.83 pm 0.07 deg/year. We also identified a strong core flux variability with possible periodicity and a 2 sigma correlation between the core flux density and the inner jet PA change. We discuss possible physical models that could explain the observed features for this object; in particular, a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, Lense Thirring (LT) effect, and jet or disk instabilities. The oscillation and continuous shift of the PA and the possible radio flux periodicity, together with the optical flux periodicity of approximately 2 years that had previously been confirmed in several independent studies, favor a jet precession scenario driven by orbital motion and disk-orbit misalignment in a SMBHB system.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18551v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Different Transient Phenomena at the Edges of Traveling Foreshocks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18553</link><description>arXiv:2601.18553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations have shown that traveling foreshocks (TFs) are bounded by either foreshock compressional boundaries (FCBs) or foreshock bubbles (FBs). Here we present four TFs with a different kind of structure appearing at one of their edges. Two of them, observed by the Cluster mission, are bounded by a hot flow anomaly (HFA). In one case, the HFA was observed only by the spacecraft closest to the bow shock, while the other three probes observed an FCB. In addition, two other TFs were observed by the MMS spacecraft to be delimited by a structure that we call HFA-like FCB. In the spacecraft data, these structures present signatures similar to those of HFAs: dips in magnetic field magnitude and solar wind density, decelerated and deflected plasma flow and increased temperature. However, a detailed inspection of these events reveals the absence of heating of the SW beam. Instead, the beam almost disappears inside these events and the plasma moments are strongly influenced by the suprathermal particles. We suggest that HFA-like FCBs are related to the evolution and structure of the directional discontinuities of the interplanetary magnetic field whose thickness is larger than the gyroradious of suprathermal ions. We also show that individual TFs may appear together with several different types of transient upstream mesoscale structures, which brings up a question about their combined effect on regions downstream of the bow shock.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18553v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] tilepy: A Flexible Open-Source Scheduling Engine for Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18668</link><description>arXiv:2601.18668v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS) measured the optical/NIR colours of a brightness-complete sample of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). Like previous surveys, this one found a bimodal colour distribution in TNOs, categorised as red and very red. Additionally, this survey proposed an alternative surface classification scheme: FaintIR and BrightIR. Cold classical TNOs mostly have very red or FaintIR surfaces, while dynamically excited TNOs show a mixture of surfaces. This likely indicates that formation locations and proximity to the Sun influenced surface characteristics and color changes. Our study combines the data from Col-OSSOS with two dynamical models describing the formation of the Kuiper belt during Neptune's migration. We investigate the proposed surface-colour changing line and explore the distribution of different surfaces within the primordial disk. By comparing radial colour transitions across various scenarios, we explore the origins of surface characteristics and their implications within the context of BrightIR and FaintIR classifications. Moreover, we extend our analysis to examine the distribution of these surface classes within the present-day Kuiper Belt, providing insights into the configuration of the early solar system's planetesimal disk prior to giant planet migration. We find that the most likely primordial disk compositions are inner neutral / outer red (with transition $30.0^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au), or inner BrightIR / outer FaintIR (with transition $31.5^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au).</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18776v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Baryonification III: An accurate analytical model for the dispersion measure probability density function of fast radio bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18784</link><description>arXiv:2601.18784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a fully analytical framework for predicting the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of dispersion measures (DM) for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the baryonification (BFC) model. BFC provides a computationally efficient alternative to expensive hydrodynamical simulations for modelling baryonic effects on cosmological scales. By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($\mu$), and outer truncation ($\delta$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs. Our work provides a self-consistent model that links gas density profiles to integrated DM statistics, enabling future constraints on baryonic feedback processes from FRB observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.18784v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Search for spatial coincidence between magnetars and IceCube detected neutrinos</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05100</link><description>arXiv:2503.05100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a search for spatial coincidence between high energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino detector (using the publicly available 10-year muon track data) and 37 magnetars, including six extragalactic sources. We use the unbinned maximum likelihood method for our analysis. We do not find any such spatial association between any of the known magnetars and IceCube-detected neutrinos. Therefore, we conclude that none of the known galactic or extragalactic magnetars contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux observed in IceCube. A stacked analysis also does not show a statistically significant excess.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2503.05100v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Probing Cosmic Curvature with Fast Radio Bursts and DESI DR2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01504</link><description>arXiv:2506.01504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatial curvature of the Universe remains a central question in modern cosmology. In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 120 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, and use it to obtain angular-diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ directly from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmology. Then, we combine the FRB-based $H(z)$ with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) DESI DR2 measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$, we constrain spatial curvature. Our covariance-based likelihood (accounting for correlated uncertainties) yields $\Omega_k = -0.31\pm0.57$, while a diagonal (Gaussian) treatment gives $\Omega_k = -0.13\pm0.46$. Both estimations are consistent with spatial flatness at the $1\sigma$ level, albeit with a mild preference for negative curvature. Explicitly accounting for the full covariance broadens the intervals and avoids underestimation of uncertainties. These results highlight the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and their synergy with BAO as a powerful, cosmological model-independent probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01504v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The environment of TeV halo progenitors</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01495</link><description>arXiv:2507.01495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TeV haloes are extended sources of very-high-energy gamma rays found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding the type of medium pulsars probe over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions - where they receive a natal kick - until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; and (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess the medium in which pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derived the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population and then applied the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the interstellar medium at around 300 kyr, significantly later than assumed in the literature. Given our assumptions, all known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. To test this, we provide the probability that known pulsars still reside in their parent environment for a list of known pulsars.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.01495v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cosmographic constraints from late-time probes including fast radio bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06975</link><description>arXiv:2507.06975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we use late-time probes, such as well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SNe), and cosmic chronometers (CC) to constrain cosmological parameters through a model-independent cosmographic approach. By integrating FRB data with BAO from DESI DR2, SNe, and CC, we derive constraints on the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration parameter ($q_0$), and the jerk parameter ($j_0$), using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for parameter estimation. The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 66.35^{+4.13}_{-5.04} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.33^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$, and $j_0 = 0.83^{+0.57}_{-0.67}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 6\%$ for the Hubble constant and showing consistency with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation. The DESI+CMB dataset yields $H_0 = 65.59^{+1.25}_{-1.24} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.29^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$, and $j_0 = 0.58^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$, providing a $\sim 2\%$ precision on $H_0$ and may suggest a possible tension in the late-time kinematic sector relative to the $\Lambda$CDM expectation when BAO measurements are calibrated with a Planck-inferred sound horizon. Combining the FRB, SNe, DESI+CMB, and CC datasets further tightens the constraints to $H_0 = 68.03^{+0.53}_{-0.52} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.41 \pm 0.02$, and $j_0 = 0.55 \pm 0.02$, with the jerk parameter remaining lower than $j_0 = 1$ at the $1\sigma$ confidence level. These findings hint at a possible late-time kinematic tension, as indicated by the inferred value of the jerk parameter, which is primarily driven by the DESI+CMB dataset under standard early-Universe assumptions for the sound horizon.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.06975v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cosmic-ray impact on optical and mid-infrared emission line diagnostics in NGC 5728</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14328</link><description>arXiv:2509.14328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.14328v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Influence of the Spectral Energy Distribution of Reionization-Era Sources on the Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15179</link><description>arXiv:2509.15179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest properties during the epoch of reionization requires assumptions about the spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources. These are often simplified to blackbody or power-law spectra, potentially overlooking contributions from high-energy processes. In this work, we investigate how different SED models of reionization-era sources shape the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and imprint on the Ly$\alpha$ forest during the late stages of reionization. We perform $3D$ radiative transfer simulations with CRASH, post-processed on Sherwood-type hydrodynamical outputs, exploring both physically motivated SEDs including X-ray binaries, Bremsstrahlung from shock-heated interstellar medium, and binary stars and idealized blackbody and power-law spectra. While the large-scale morphology of ionized regions is broadly similar across all models, harder spectral components extend partially ionized zones, produce larger He III regions, and heat the surrounding IGM. By adopting simplified spectra there is the risk of underestimating the contribution of high-energy sources, which for most models we consider are found to alter the effective optical depth, the flux power, and the local transmissivity within the current $\sim 1 \sigma$ measurement uncertainties. The differences across models are most pronounced in the behavior of the proximity zone and in the power at intermediate scales, offering the most promising diagnostics to disentangle source populations. With upcoming high precision measurements from ELT and DESI, realistic SED modelling will be essential for robustly connecting Ly$\alpha$ forest observations to the sources driving the end of reionization.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.15179v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A in a High Density Environment</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132</link><description>arXiv:2510.19132v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBR\'I, the Harlingten 50~cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Einstein Probe, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+3\times 10^4$ s (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0 \sim 5\times 10^4$ s, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a collapsar environment.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.19132v5</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10785</link><description>arXiv:2511.10785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.10785v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Milky Way galaxy-analogs and isolated galaxies with bars: environmental density in the Local Volume</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18612</link><description>arXiv:2511.18612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The environmental density of galaxies within the cosmic web constrains their 3D locations in filaments, voids, groups, and clusters. It traces the distribution of baryons and the influence of dark-matter halos on galaxy evolution, and helps diagnose external processes such as supernova and AGN feedback, tidal interactions, ram-pressure stripping, and large-scale flows. We focus on isolated barred galaxies, the parent population that includes Milky Way analogs. To measure local environmental density and verify isolation (|Delta v| &lt;= 500 km s^-1), we built a Python pipeline that works in two redshift regimes: low (z0 &lt; 0.02) and high (z0 &gt;= 0.02). Densities were estimated with k-nearest neighbors and Voronoi tessellations and classified as void (Sigma &lt; 0.05), filament (0.05 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 0.5), group (0.5 &lt;= Sigma &lt; 2.0), and cluster (Sigma &gt;= 2.0). Our northern-sky sample contains 311 isolated barred galaxies from 2MIG plus Milky Way analog systems (z &lt; 0.07). We find 157 void, 84 filament, 27 group, and 11 cluster galaxies; 30 have no detected neighbors. Sixty-seven lie in extremely low-density regions (Sigma_3D &lt; 0.01 gal Mpc^-3), and 22 have the nearest companion beyond 5 Mpc, indicating residence in extended voids. The Milky Way (Sigma_5NN ~ 0.13 gal Mpc^-3, R ~ 2.1 Mpc) and its close analog NGC 3521 both lie in filamentary environments at the edge of a nearby void. For z &gt; 0.02 we identify three additional Milky Way analog candidates from the density metrics: CGCG 208-043 (3D Voronoi) and NGC 5231 and CGCG 047-026 (5th-nearest neighbor). These results show that local environmental density is an effective, physically motivated criterion for selecting Milky Way analogs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.18612v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Fastest or Significant: A Systematic Framework for Validating Global Minimum Variability Timescale Measurements of Gamma-ray Bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16204</link><description>arXiv:2512.16204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimum variability timescale (MVT) is a key observable used to probe the central engines of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) by constraining the emission region size and the outflow Lorentz factor. However, its interpretation is often ambiguous: statistical noise and analysis choices can bias measurements, making it difficult to distinguish genuine source variability from artifacts. Here we perform a comprehensive suite of simulations to establish a quantitative framework for validating Haar-based MVT measurements. We show that in multi--component light curves, the MVT returns the most statistically significant structure in the interval, which is not necessarily the fastest intrinsic timescale, and can therefore converge to intermediate values. Reliability is found to depend jointly on the MVT value and its signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$), with shorter intrinsic timescales requiring proportionally higher $\mathrm{SNR}_{\mathrm{MVT}}$ to be resolved.
  We use this relation to define an empirical MVT Validation Curve, and provide a practical workflow to classify measurements as robust detections or upper limits. Applying this procedure to a sample of Fermi-GBM bursts shows that several published MVT values are better interpreted as upper limits. These results provide a path toward standardizing MVT analyses and highlight the caution required when inferring physical constraints from a single MVT measurement in complex events.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16204v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13200</link><description>arXiv:2601.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modelled via an $\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13200v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Reducing Simulation Dependence in Neutrino Telescopes with Masked Point Transformers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01733</link><description>arXiv:2510.01733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques in neutrino physics have traditionally relied on simulated data, which provides access to ground-truth labels. However, the accuracy of these simulations and the discrepancies between simulated and real data remain significant concerns, particularly for large-scale neutrino telescopes that operate in complex natural media. In recent years, self-supervised learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for reducing dependence on labeled datasets. Here, we present the first self-supervised training pipeline for neutrino telescopes, leveraging point cloud transformers and masked autoencoders. By shifting the majority of training to real data, this approach minimizes reliance on simulations, thereby mitigating associated systematic uncertainties. This represents a fundamental departure from previous machine learning applications in neutrino telescopes, paving the way for substantial improvements in event reconstruction and classification.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.01733v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] A Method for Quantifying Paleoenvironmental Impacts on Lunar Recession and the Moon’s Age</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae274f</link><description>Geological evidence indicates that the Moon formed at least 4.46 billion years ago. Models of Earth–Moon evolution generally describe tidal friction as the primary driver of lunar recession—the gradual increase in the lunar orbital semimajor axis—and the corresponding lengthening of Earth’s day. However, tidal dissipation within Earth’s oceans is sensitive to climatic and tectonic boundary conditions, which introduce variability not fully captured in existing models. Here, we develop a probabilistic framework that quantifies lunar recession and its variations by incorporating the influence of climate dynamics, plate tectonics, and geological constraints on Earth’s length-of-day evolution. Applied to the past 1 billion years, the analysis yields an additional, previously unrecognized long-term lunar recession of ∼0.84 mm yr−1, equivalent to an orbital expansion of ∼808 km. This signal is primarily associated with sea-level change acting on the surface of the Earth with evolving plate configurations, with a particularly strong expression during the Cenozoic Era. The revised recession history adds an uncertainty of ∼15 million years to the lunar age. These findings suggest that slightly lower tidal dissipation rates than those used in earlier models provide better agreement with geological constraints on lunar chronology.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae274f</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Extremely Luminous Optical Afterglow of an Energetic Gamma-Ray Burst GRB 230204B</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2794</link><description>Robotic telescope networks play an important role in capturing early and bright optical afterglows, providing critical insights into the energetics and emission mechanisms of GRBs. In this study, we analyze GRB 230204B, an exceptionally energetic and multipulsed long GRB, detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and MAXI detectors, with an isotropic equivalent gamma-ray energy exceeding 1054 erg. Time-resolved spectral analysis reveals a transition in the prompt emission from hard (sub-photospheric-dominated) spectra during early pulses to softer (synchrotron-radiation-dominated) spectra in later pulses, indicative of a hybrid jet composition. We report the discovery and characterization of the optical afterglow using the Mobile Astronomical System of Telescope-Robots (MASTER) and Burst Observer and Optical Transient Exploring System (BOOTES) robotic telescope networks, which enabled rapid follow-up observations starting at ∼1.3 ks post-burst. The optical luminosity at this time was exceptionally high, surpassing that of many other optically bright GRBs, such as GRB 990123 and GRB 080319B. This places the burst among the most luminous optical GRBs observed to date. Long-term radio observations extending to 335 days post-burst were conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. Multiwavelength modeling, incorporating data from MASTER, BOOTES, Devasthal Optical Telescope, Swift/XRT, and radio observations, was conducted using an external interstellar medium (ISM) forward-shock top-hat jet model with afterglowpy. The results reveal a narrow and highly collimated jet with a circumburst density of n0 ∼ 28.12 cm−3, kinetic energy EK ∼ 4.18 × 1055 erg, and a relatively low value of ϵB = 2.14 × 10−6, indicating shock-compression of the magnetic field in the surrounding ISM. We constrained a low radiative efficiency of ∼4.3%.

The recombination timescale (tr) of the absorbers is measured by analyzing the detection rate curves of absorption line variability. In particular, the detection rate curves of the absorption troughs showing blended multiple velocity components are featured by distinct “multistep” profiles, allowing for measuring tr for individual components. Among the six identified outflow components, four are found to be a few parsecs from the center, and two are 30–40 pc away.

Here, we report the detection of temporal flux variability of SBS 0335-052E in near-infrared (NIR) 3–4 μm bands on timescales of several years, showing dimming and brightening of up to 50% over 14 yr, based on archival data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Our spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of archival ultraviolet (UV)-NIR photometry, including AGN SED models, indicates that the variable NIR emission arises from an edge-on AGN dust torus. The UV-optical emission from the accretion disk is obscured and does not reach us, leading to the dominance of the host galaxy’s young stellar population in the UV-optical wavelengths. This analysis favors the presence of a Compton-thick, heavily obscured AGN in SBS 0335-052E, consistent with its observed X-ray weakness. From the SED fitting, we estimate an AGN bolometric luminosity of Lbol = 1.2 × 1043 erg s−1, which implies a black hole (BH) mass of MBH ≃ 105M⊙ if the AGN is accreting at the Eddington limit. If confirmed, SBS 0335-052E would be the least massive galaxy known to host an AGN, likely harboring an intermediate-mass BH.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29aa</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Can Clump Properties Determine Core Distribution in Star Formation? A Statistical Analysis of Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29ac</link><description>Dense cores, the progenitors of stars, are in sub-pc scale and fragmented from pc-scale clumps. However, it is still unclear how strongly the fragmentation process is affected by the properties of the host clumps and how these properties influence the core distribution observed in recent millimeter (mm) and sub-mm observations. To systematically investigate this relation, we employed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of convergent flows to generate a large sample of clumps and analyzed their properties using various techniques. Alignment parameters were used to quantify core distribution, while energy terms were calculated to assess the influence of gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulence. We found the core distribution only exhibiting weak correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties. For an individual clump, turbulence is believed to significantly contribute to these features by inducing nonhomologous collapse and ongoing fragmentation. Nevertheless, for the entire population, more compact core distributions are observed due to the dominance of gravity. Overall, these factors suggest that clump properties are not sufficient to accurately determine core distribution.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29ac</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Correlation between Hα Emitters and Their Cosmic Web Environment at z ∼ 1</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c7b</link><description>Future near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy surveys will target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to test cosmological models. Deriving optimal constraints from ELG clustering hinges on a robust understanding of their environmental dependence. Using the TNG300-1 simulation, we explore the correlation between properties of Hα emitters and their environment anisotropy rather than traditional density-based measures. Our galactic Hα emission model includes contributions from the warm interstellar medium. The environment anisotropy and type are assigned using a halo-mass-dependent smoothing scale. We find that most luminous Hα emitters (LHα &gt; 1042 erg s−1) reside in filaments and knots. More generally, Hα emitters are more biased in strongly anisotropic environments. While correlations with galactic properties are found to be weak, they are statistically significant for host halo masses M ≲ 1012M⊙h−1. Our analysis motivates further investigation into how environmental anisotropy influences galaxy evolution, and highlights the potential for leveraging these effects in the analyses of upcoming cosmological surveys.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2c7b</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Influence of Solar Source Information on Energy-dependent Solar Energetic Particle Flux and Timing Based on Solar Energetic Particle Events Observed over Four Solar Cycles</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29b3</link><description>This study is based on proton flux data from ESA’s Solar Energetic Particle Environment Modeling database, analyzing solar energetic particle (SEP) events observed near Earth from 1976 to 2017. We have matched these events with corresponding solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) to create a comprehensive list of SEP events spanning almost four solar cycles. Using this list, we conduct a statistical analysis of the flare–SEP correlation and SEP timing information. Our findings confirm that SEP events recorded at 1 au are more commonly associated with flares occurring in the western hemisphere of the Sun’s surface. Moreover, we develop an empirical model relating the SEP proton peak flux to the characteristics of flares and CMEs, which works particularly effectively for SEP events triggered by eastern flares. We also verify that flares with higher intensity are more likely to produce SEP events up to higher energies, such as those detected above 100 MeV. In this energy range, more than half of the SEP events are triggered by X-class flares. Finally, we introduce an empirical model that uses the flare longitude to predict the timing of the SEP peak flux, especially for intense flare events. These models can aid in mitigating particle radiation risks for space missions.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29b3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] A Self-consistent Scenario for the External-shock Emission in Density Jump Environments</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2acb</link><description>The standard external-shock model, assuming a homogeneous turbulent downstream, has been widely used to decipher the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts. However, such assumption is invalid when the shock encounters a density jump. In this paper, we propose a self-consistent scenario to model the external forward shock emission, involving the advection and decaying behaviors of the shock-generated magnetic fields (sgMFs) in the downstream as found in particle-in-cell simulations. In an interstellar medium, our model is almost returned to the standard model but with . Here, ϵB describes the sgMFs’ fraction of shock energy in the standard model, tdyn is the shock dynamic time, and tB together with αt depicts the sgMFs’ decaying behavior in our model. The situation is the same for the wind medium but with weak deviation in the early phase. When the shock encounters the density rise/dip, a shallower/deeper decay appears in the light curve. These behaviors are obvious for high-frequency emission or at the phase after the jet break. The GeV emission in the afterglow can serve to probe the circumburst density jump. We apply our model to decipher the later afterglows of the giant flare from SGR 1806-20. It is shown that a fireball propagating into a magnetar bow shock environment can well reproduce the observed peculiar steep decay in the radio light curve at ∼10 days from the burst.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2acb</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles] Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/k3hl-4n82</link><description>Author(s): Jamie Bamber, Antonios Tsokaros, Milton Ruiz, Stuart L.

Abstract: Giant radio haloes are diffuse synchrotron sources typically found in merging galaxy clusters, while smaller mini-haloes occur in cool-core clusters. Both trace cosmic-ray electrons in the intracluster medium, though recent observations suggest their distinction is not always clear. We present new 903-1655 MHz MeerKAT observations of Abell 1775 and Abell 1795, both hosting cool cores and cold fronts. Combined with reprocessed 120-168 MHz LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey data, we perform imaging and spectral analyses of their radio emission. In both clusters, we detect radio haloes with distinct inner and outer components. In Abell 1775, the halo appears diffuse at 1.3 GHz, while LOFAR images reveal steep-spectrum filaments. In Abell 1795, the inner component corresponds to a previously reported mini-halo candidate, but the full structure extends to $\sim$1 Mpc with a spectral index of $\alpha=-1.08\pm0.06$. The presence of such a large, flat-spectrum halo in a dynamically relaxed cluster makes Abell 1795 an outlier relative to typical merging systems. This suggests that some relaxed clusters may still retain sufficient turbulence to sustain particle re-acceleration, or that hadronic interactions producing secondary electrons play a significant role. Together with other recent discoveries in cool-core systems, our results indicate that some large radio haloes may have been overlooked in past studies due to limited dynamic range near bright central AGN. Finally, we detect steep-spectrum emission south of Abell 1795's central AGN, tracing a 45 kpc X-ray and optical filament that terminates in an X-ray cavity, likely linked to a past AGN outburst.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16288v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion flow in a stratified layer</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16395</link><description>arXiv:2601.16395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the density and velocity profiles along the tail induced by a body of mass $M$, embedded in the midplane of a vertically-stratified media with scaleheight $H$, adopting a one-dimensional model as in the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton problem. In analogy to what occurs in the case of a homogeneous medium, there exist a family of solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions. A shooting method is employed to isolate those solutions that fulfill a specific set of physical and mathematical constraints. The tail is found to be both densest and slowest when the scaleheight $H$ is equal to the gravitational radius $\xi_{0}\equiv GM/v_{0}^{2}$, where $v_{0}$ its relative velocity with respect to the medium. The location of the stagnation point is evaluated as a function of $H$ and $\xi_{0}$, and an empirical fitting formula is provided. While the distance to the stagnation point is maximized when $H\simeq \xi_{0}$, the mass accretion rate attains its maximum value for $H \ll \xi_{0}$ at fixed surface density. When instead the midplane density is held constant and $H$ is varied, the accretion rate hardly changes once $H$ exceeds about $2\xi_{0}$. Additionally, we investigate how both the drag force resulting from mass accretion and the gravitational drag arising from its tail depend on $H/\xi_{0}$. We highlight how the effect of varying the degree of mixing in the tail influences the resulting drag force. Finally, for the particular case of an infinitely thin layer, we provide a simple analytical solution, which may serve as a useful pedagogical reference.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16395v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Star formation outside galaxies undergoing gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions: dust attenuation and the star formation rate</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16439</link><description>arXiv:2601.16439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies undergo perturbations, either gravitational or hydrodynamic in origin, which can generate extragalactic structures such as rings and tails, where in situ star formation may take place. We selected a sample consisting of JO201 and JW100, undergoing ram-pressure stripping, and NGC 5291 and NGC 7252, formed through gravitational interactions, to investigate how different perturbation mechanisms influence dust content and star formation in extragalactic features. In both cases, star formation can be observed outside the main disks of the galaxies. We present new results of dust attenuation for JO201 and JW100, while for NGC 5291 and NGC 7252 we use results from our previous study, based on high-resolution observations obtained with the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope onboard AstroSat. Dust attenuation is determined from the ultraviolet continuum slope ($\beta$) calculated using the FUV-NUV colour, and the star formation rates of the star-forming knots are corrected accordingly. It is seen that dust attenuation and dust-corrected SFR densities of the knots in the ram-pressure stripped tails of JO201 and JW100 are comparable to those in the collisional ring of the NGC 5291 system and the tidal tails of the NGC 7252 system. We conclude that, though the formation scenarios of the tails of JO201 and JW100, the NGC 5291 ring, and the NGC 7252 tails are different, their dust content and star formation activity are notably similar.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16439v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] GRBAlpha, VZLUSAT-2 and GRBBeta -- GRB observations with CubeSats</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16609</link><description>arXiv:2601.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results from GRBAlpha, VZLUSAT-2 and GRBBeta CubeSats and their on-board gamma-ray detectors for monitoring transients are summarised in this article. GRBAlpha was a 1U CubeSat launched in March 2021 to a 550 km altitude polar orbit carrying a CsI(Tl) scintillator gamma-ray burst (GRB) detector with a sensitive range of approximately 30-900 keV. It successfully operated for over four years until June 2025 when it de-orbited. VZLUSAT-2 was a 3U CubeSat launched in January 2022 to a 535 km altitude polar orbit and de-orbited in November 2025 after almost four years of smooth operation. It carried on board two GRB detectors very similar to the one used on GRBAlpha. Both missions have detected about 360 gamma-ray transients, including over 170 long and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and including the most intense GRB ever recorded GRB 221009A and the second brightest GRB 230307A. The new family member, GRBBeta 2U CubeSat, integrated at Masaryk University, was launched in July 2024 to a 580 km altitude, 62 degree inclination orbit. It has been detecting GRBs since its launch without any trouble. Gamma-ray detectors on these nanosatellites are based on CsI(Tl) scintillator readout by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). These missions also provide a unique opportunity to study the radiation damage of SiPMs in the low Earth orbit environment and monitor the radiation belts. We have demonstrated that CubeSats can be used in missions lasting beyond three years and routinely detect GRBs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16609v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search.

Abstract: A search for pulsars was carried out using a Large Phased Array (LPA) radio telescope at a frequency of 110.4 MHz with a time resolution of 3.072 ms and a frequency resolution of 19.5 kHz with a 2.5 MHz bandwidth used. The survey was conducted in a site with declinations of $+53^\circ &lt; \delta &lt; +87^\circ$. The viewing area is approximately 4100 sq.deg. The search was carried out using Fourier power spectra. To increase sensitivity, multiple observations were made in each direction in the sky, and the resulting power spectra were summarized. This made it possible to increase sensitivity by about 5-10 times, depending on the direction in the sky. A blind search opened 35 known pulsars. Estimates of the flux density for 33 pulsars have been obtained.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16714v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Gaia20dsk: A new MNor discovered by the GLORIOUS collaboration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16826</link><description>arXiv:2601.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Among known young stellar objects (YSOs), those exhibiting the most dramatic increases in brightness due to sudden increase in mass accretion rate are eruptive young stars. Gaia20dsk is one of the Gaia-alerted young star candidates that has displayed a double, nonperiodic brightening resembling that of other young eruptive stars.
  Aims. The goal of this work is to determine the physical and accretion properties of Gaia20dsk to confirm its classification as an eruptive young star.
  Methods. We combined publicly available optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry with our X-shooter optical/NIR spectrum. In our analysis, we examined the optical and IR light curves from the bursts, reviewing the color-magnitude diagrams across different bands, reporting the detection of emission lines, and providing estimates of the star's accretion rates during the burst.
  Results. The optical light curve shows two major and one brief brightening events with a maximum amplitude of ~1.8 mag in the last five years. A classification based on spectral index indicates that Gaia20dsk is a flat-spectrum star. The X-shooter spectrum exhibit emission lines characteristic of accreting low-to-intermediate-mass young stars, displaying features typical of MNor-type objects. The mass accretion rate is between (0.5-1.8)*10^{-6} M_sun/yr.
  Conclusions. Gaia20dsk is an eruptive YSO that exhibits photometric features similar to those of MNors, including its characteristic brightening amplitude and burst duration, along with similar spectroscopic features and accretion rates.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16826v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] CosmoSlider: An educational tool for cosmology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16919</link><description>arXiv:2601.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cosmological parameters influence the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra is a central component of modern cosmology education, but interactive exploration is often limited by computational cost or technical complexity. We present CosmoSlider, a lightweight visualization tool that enables real-time exploration of CMB power spectra as multiple cosmological parameters are varied simultaneously. The tool employs a neural-network emulator implemented using TensorFlow Lite, allowing rapid evaluation of spectra without relying on large grids of precomputed models or on-demand execution of Einstein--Boltzmann solvers. CosmoSlider is available both as an iOS application and as a web-based tool, making it accessible across platforms and suitable for use in classrooms, lectures, and self-guided study. By providing immediate visual feedback, CosmoSlider supports the development of intuition for the physical processes underlying CMB anisotropies and serves as a complementary resource to traditional theoretical instruction.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16919v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Thick Lunar Crust Amplifies Gravitational-Wave Signal</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16567</link><description>arXiv:2601.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) in the $10^{-3}-0.1$ Hz band encode unique signatures of the early universe and merging compact objects, but they are beyond the reach of existing observatories. Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features. Our work establishes the Moon as an accurately calibrated resonant GW detector, and the resulting amplification maps provide quantitative guide for the optimal landing site selection.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16567v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200</link><description>arXiv:2510.06200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06200v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Photon rest mass from localized fast radio bursts with improved distribution of dispersion measure from extragalactic gas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14163</link><description>arXiv:2511.14163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assumption that photons are massless is a foundational postulate of modern physics, yet it remains subject to experimental verification. Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their cosmological distances and precisely measured dispersion, offer an excellent laboratory for testing this hypothesis. In this work, we propose an improved distribution function for the dispersion measure arising from extragalactic gas and demonstrate that it provides an excellent fit to mock data. We then apply this distribution to constrain the photon rest mass under the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM cosmological models, the last of which is favored by recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation observations. The corresponding 1$\sigma$ upper limits on the photon mass are found to be $4.83\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, $4.71\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, and $4.86\times10^{-51}\,\mathrm{kg}$, respectively, which are the most stringent constraints derived from FRBs to date. These results indicate that the choice of cosmological model has only a minor impact on photon-mass bounds, demonstrate that FRBs provide robust and reliable constraints, and offer strong empirical support for the massless nature of the photon.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.14163v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] JWST Confirmation of a Runaway Supermassive Black Hole via its Supersonic Bow Shock</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04166</link><description>arXiv:2512.04166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of a candidate runaway supermassive black hole at the tip of a 62 kpc-long linear feature at z=0.96. The JWST data show a sharp kinematic discontinuity at the tip, with a radial velocity change of $\approx 600$ km/s across 0.1'' (1 kpc). The velocity gradient, together with the projected post-shock flow velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s, is well described by a simple shock-compression model of a supersonic object, with a velocity of $v_{BH} = 954^{+110}_{-126}$ km/s and an inclination $i=29^{+6}_{-3}$ deg. The previously puzzling kinematics along the linear feature, with the observed radial velocity decreasing from $\approx 300$ km/s near the tip to $\approx 100$ km/s closer to the former host galaxy, are naturally explained as gradual downstream mixing of shocked gas with the circumgalactic medium through turbulent entrainment. The bow shock interpretation is further supported by the morphology of the gas at the tip of the wake and an analysis of the [OIII]/H$\alpha$, [NII]/H$\alpha$, [SII]/H$\alpha$, and [SIII]/[SII] line ratios. The line ratios are consistent with fast radiative shocks and rapid cooling, with best-fit shock velocities that are in agreement with expectations from the black hole velocity and the shock geometry. Energy conservation over the lifetime of the wake suggests a SMBH mass of $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$. These results confirm that the wake is powered by a supersonic runaway supermassive black hole, a long-predicted consequence of gravitational-wave recoil or multi-body ejection from galactic nuclei.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04166v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] One Attempt at Building an Inclusive &amp; Accessible Hybrid Astronomy Conference: FRB 2025</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14357</link><description>arXiv:2601.14357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) field has been accompanied by a simultaneous growth of FRB conferences. While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montr\'eal in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success.

Most DWDs in the LISA band are far from merging and emit quasimonochromatic GWs. As these sources are distributed throughout the Milky Way, they experience different accelerations in the Galactic gravitational potential, and therefore each DWD exhibits an apparent GW frequency chirp due to differential acceleration between the source and LISA. We examine how Galactic acceleration influences parameter estimation for these sources; and investigate how LISA observations could provide insight into the distribution of matter in the Galaxy.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2405.13109v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Taxonomy of periodic orbits and gravitational waves in a deformed Schwarzschild black hole spacetime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00550</link><description>arXiv:2601.00550v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00550v4</guid></item><item><title>[Journal of Cosm] Probing quantum corrected black hole through astrophysical tests with the orbit of S2 star and quasiperiodic oscillations</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/044</link><description>In this study, we explore the influence of the quantum correction parameter ξ on the motion of particles and the properties of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around a quantum-corrected black hole (QCBH).

Abstract: We present OmniSpectra, the first native-resolution foundation model for astronomy spectra. Unlike traditional models, which are limited to fixed-length input sizes or configurations, OmniSpectra handles spectra of any length at their original size, without resampling or interpolation. Despite the large-scale spectroscopic data from diverse surveys fueling the rapid growth of astronomy, existing foundation models are limited to a fixed wavelength range and specific instruments. OmniSpectra is the first foundation model to learn simultaneously from multiple real-world spectra surveys with different configurations at a large scale. We achieve this by designing a novel architecture with adaptive patching across variable lengths, sinusoidal global wavelength encoding, local positional embeddings through depthwise convolution, and validity-aware self-attention masks. Allowing us to learn multi-scale spatial patterns while skipping attention for invalid patches. Even with a limited training example, OmniSpectra demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization compared to methods tailored for specific tasks. This transfer learning capability makes this model the state-of-the-art across various astronomy tasks, including source classification, redshift estimation, and properties prediction for stars and galaxies. OmniSpectra reduces the need for training individual models for different tasks from scratch, establishing itself as the next-generation astronomy foundation model.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15351v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] What factors shape the radio luminosity of star-forming galaxies?

Abstract: Radio observations offer a dust-unobscured view of galaxy star formation via the radio continuum-star formation rate (RC--SFR) relation. Emerging evidence of a stellar mass dependence in the RC--SFR relation raises the broader question of how other galaxy properties may influence this relation. In this work, we study the dependence of the global RC--SFR relation on galaxy properties in local ($z\,\leq$\,0.3) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS-DR2). Employing a non-parametric decision-tree regression algorithm, we identify the most important galaxy properties for estimating the radio luminosity using a sample of 18,828 emission-line-classified SFGs based on spectroscopic data from the SDSS-DR8. Along with the spectroscopically obtained SFRs and stellar mass values, we also use SFRs and stellar masses derived using photometric SED-fitting from the \textit{GALEX}--SDSS--\textit{WISE} Legacy Catalogue (GSWLC) for the same sample. We find that a galaxy's SFR is most important for predicting the radio luminosity, followed by the stellar mass, at $&gt;5\sigma$ significance. Complementing the LoTSS catalogue 150\,MHz flux densities with aperture photometry for the rest of the emission-line classified sample (35,099 galaxies in total), we obtain a new calibration of the RC--SFR relation, which does not change significantly whether we use spectroscopic or photometrically derived SFRs and stellar masses, despite the fact that the methods probe star formation on different characteristic timescales. Our results highlight the utility of decision-tree algorithms for handling censored radio-selected galaxy samples, which will be useful for future spectroscopic surveys of radio sources.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15374v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] K-DRIFT Science Theme: Galactic Cirrus Clouds and Circumgalactic Medium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15665</link><description>arXiv:2601.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we review the extended halo material and the circumgalactic medium (CGM), including both dust and gas, and discuss promising science cases that could be realized using the KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT). Scattered starlight from cirrus clouds in our Galaxy poses one of the major challenges to studying the low surface brightness features of extragalactic sources. Therefore, it is essential to investigate how to discriminate extragalactic sources from the cirrus cloud features. At the same time, interstellar dust clouds themselves are fundamental to understanding dust properties and the interstellar radiation field, both of which are essential for studies of chemical evolution and star formation in our Galaxy. Measuring the reddening of background sources, such as quasars, with K-DRIFT, which benefits from its broad field of view and accurate background subtraction, allows for effective detection of extended dust in galactic halos, the CGM, and intracluster space. Observations of the H-alpha emission lines can be used to identify signatures of star formation activity within galaxies, as well as the environmental effects acting on them. Galactic winds driven by active galactic nuclei and starbursts can be traced through H-alpha emission. Strong ram pressure stripping effectively removes the interstellar medium (ISM) from galaxies. The stripped ISM becomes ionized or dissociated through mixing with the hot intracluster medium (ICM), forming H-alpha tails. The surface brightness of these H-alpha tails correlates not only with the presence of star formation in the tails but also the mixing stage of the stripped ISM and ICM. The H-alpha survey with K-DRIFT will enable the investigation of the evolutionary stages of ram pressure stripped galaxies in cluster environments, as well as the multiphase gas reservoir around galaxies and in the CGM.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15665v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] GRB~250704B/EP250704a a Short Gamma-Ray Burst Powered by a Magnetar</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15732</link><description>arXiv:2601.15732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB~250704B/EP250704a, identified as a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), exhibited prolonged X-ray emission following the prompt phase and, in optical and infrared (IR) bands, an unusual one-day plateau succeeded by a rapid decline. This sGRB was observed by multiple satellites and ground-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum. This study presents temporal and spectral analyses from radio to gamma-ray frequencies, spanning several observation periods beginning after the trigger and continuing for nearly 2 days. The results of the temporal and spectral analyses of the prompt episode, the extended X-ray component, and the afterglow phase are consistent with a millisecond magnetar undergoing accretion. The long-lasting X-ray emission is attributed to the internal energy dissipation of the magnetar spin-down power, governed by the magnetization parameter; the extended optical/IR plateau to synchrotron afterglow emission with energy injection; and the steep decay to changes in microphysical parameters during the post-jet break phase. The X-ray observations are consistent with the superposition of spin-down luminosity and synchrotron afterglow scenario. These findings suggest that the compact-object remnant is most likely a long-lived magnetar.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15732v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Nucleosynthesis in Type Ia Supernovae, Classical Novae, and Type I X-Ray Bursts.

Abstract: Nuclear astrophysics aims at unraveling the cosmic origins of chemical elements and the physical processes powering stars. It constitutes a truly multidisciplinary field, that integrates tools, advancements, and accomplishments from theoretical astrophysics, observational astronomy, cosmochemistry, and theoretical and experimental atomic and nuclear physics. For instance, the advent of high-energy astrophysics, facilitated by space-borne observatories, has ushered in a new era, offering a unique, panchromatic view of the universe (i.e., allowing multifrequency observations of stellar events); supercomputers are also playing a pivotal role, furnishing astrophysicists with computational capabilities essential for studying the intricate evolution of stars within a multidimensional framework; cosmochemists, through examination of primitive meteorites, are uncovering tiny fragments of stardust, shedding light on the physical processes operating in stars and on the mechanisms that govern condensation of stellar ejecta into solids; simultaneously, nuclear physicists managed to measure nuclear reactions at (or close to) stellar energies, using both stable and radioactive ion beam facilities. This paper provides a multidisciplinary view on nucleosynthesis accompanying stellar explosions, with a specific focus on thermonuclear supernovae, classical novae, and type I X-ray bursts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15740v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] There Is More to Outshining: 2D Dust Effects on Stellar Mass Estimates at $3 \leq z &lt; 9$ with JWST in the JADES Field</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15963</link><description>arXiv:2601.15963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust attenuation modifies the observed spectral energy distribution (SED), leading to biases in the properties inferred from integrated SED fitting. As spatially resolved SED modeling becomes feasible for large high-redshift samples, it is increasingly important to assess how dust attenuation affects resolved mass estimates. We evaluate the impact of dust attenuation on stellar mass estimates derived from integrating spatially resolved SED fitting results. We perform spatially resolved and integrated SED fitting on a sample of 3408 galaxies at $3 \leq z &lt; 9$ from the GOODS South field, combining deep NIRCam from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) and HST/ACS imaging from GOODS and CANDELS. We compare galaxy-integrated properties derived from fitting the summed SED with those obtained from spatially resolved SED modeling. Using a two-component dust attenuation model with a variable slope, we investigate how the dust attenuation slope, A(V), and stellar population properties contribute to discrepancies in the resulting stellar mass estimates. Resolved stellar masses are systematically higher than integrated estimates, with a median offset of +0.24 dex. Resolved analyses recover higher dust attenuations ($\Delta A(V)\approx +0.08$ mag), lower birth cloud fractions ($\Delta\mu \approx -0.28$), and grayer attenuation curves ($\Delta\delta_{\mathrm{ISM}} = +0.08$), arising from preferential sampling of compact star-forming regions. Integrated fits underestimate stellar ages by $\sim23\%$ at $z &lt; 5$ and 31$\%$ at $z \gtrsim 5$. The stellar mass offset correlates strongly with the age difference and the attenuation slope difference, indicating that age-dependent outshining and spatially varying dust geometry are primary drivers of the discrepancy between resolved and integrated stellar masses.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15963v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A multi-wavelength approach of AGN feedback in LINERs: The case of NGC 4438</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15991</link><description>arXiv:2601.15991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of multi-phase outflows in low ionisation nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) has been confirmed to be frequent, but the mechanisms that launch them are still under study. We aim to explore the connections between the ionised gas outflow, radio continuum structures and X-ray emission detected in the LINER NGC4438. We analyse L, C and X-band images (from 1.4 to 12 GHz) of the LINER NGC4438, combining high-resolution data from enhanced Multi Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (e-MERLIN) and Karl G Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). We produce radio flux, spectral index maps, and an energetic model that allows us to characterise the source. We incorporate optical integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data (GTC/MEGARA) and Chandra X-ray data, with comparable resolution, to better trace the outflow, the AGN and their potential connection. We present new L, C, and X-band high-resolution, high-sensitivity radio images and spectral-index maps that probe $\sim$ 25 pc scales in NGC 4438. These data reveal a close morphological correspondence between the radio structures and the ionised gas bubble. Using a spatially resolved energetic model based on radio flux and spectral index, we disentangle the compact AGN emission from the extended bubble for the first time, establishing their distinct physical origins. We measure a kinetic power of $\sim 5\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the radio bubble, exceeding the power of the ionised outflow by more than three orders of magnitude. Our multi-wavelength analysis indicates that NGC 4438 is undergoing jet-mode feedback, where a low-luminosity, weakly collimated jet impacts the dense northern interstellar medium. This interaction drives shock-ionised gas, produces a moderate velocity outflow that removes material from the region, and generates thermal X-ray emission coincident with the radio and H$\alpha$ cavity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15991v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Unveiling the Spectral Morphological Division of Fast Radio Bursts with CHIME/FRB Catalog 2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16048</link><description>arXiv:2601.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain. In this work, we apply an unsupervised machine learning methods combining Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with density-based clustering to analyze CHIME/FRB Catalog 2. We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16048v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Magnetar fraction in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16159</link><description>arXiv:2601.16159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($&lt;$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($&lt;$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16159v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A multiwavelength ALMA view of gas and dust in binary protoplanetary system AS 205: Evidence of dust asymmetric distribution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16202</link><description>arXiv:2601.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of multi-wavelength dust emissions at 3.1\,mm and 1.3\,mm; along with molecular line emissions of CO(2--1), CO(3--2), \mbox{$^{13}$CO(3--2)}, and C$^{18}$O(3--2) at spatial resolutions of 7--45 AU towards the protoplanetary system AS 205. The dust emissions exhibit two distinct components of AS 205 N and AS 205 S, separated by 1.3 arcsec. While gas kinematics within the dust disk regions are dominated by Keplerian rotation, the more extended gas emission displays complex morphology and kinematics strongly affected by the binary gravitational interaction in the outer regions. The stellar masses of AS 205 N and AS 205 S are estimated at $0.78\pm0.19$\,M$_\odot$ and $1.93\pm0.86$\,M$_\odot$, respectively. Azimuthal variation is observed in the spectral index distribution of both disks. In AS 205 N, the spectral index minimum in the southwest is coincident with the peaks of CO($2-1$), CO($3-2$), and $^{13}$CO($3-2$) integrated intensity and the relative position of its southern counterpart. On the other hand, the spectral index distribution in \ass~exhibits two prominent maxima, with the one in the northeast aligning with the peak of $^{13}$CO($3-2$), and the peak in the south coinciding with local maxima in CO($2-1$) and CO($3-2$) azimuthal profiles. These results suggest a correlation between dust grain size and/or optical depth with the gas distributions. Dust-trapping along the spiral arms possibly contributes to the spectral index minima in AS 205 N; however, the observed asymmetry across both disks suggests the involvement of additional mechanisms.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.16202v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] AT2019cmw: A highly luminous, cooling featureless TDE candidate from the disruption of a high mass star in an early-type galaxy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07380</link><description>arXiv:2507.07380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical/UV photometric and spectroscopic observations, as well as X-ray and radio follow-up, of the extraordinary event AT2019cmw. With a peak bolometric luminosity of ~$\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from ~30 kK to ~10 kK in the first ~300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH. This could provide a new window to probe nuclear star formation and the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) in close proximity to SMBHs out to relatively high redshifts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.07380v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Multi-color characterization of optically invisible FU Orionis-type outbursts: Demonstration and prospects for the WINTER survey</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04560</link><description>arXiv:2509.04560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Episodic mass accretion is the dominant mechanism for mass assembly in the proto-stellar phase. Although prior optical time-domain searches have allowed detailed studies of individual outbursts, these searches remain insensitive to the earliest stages of star formation. In this paper, we present the characterization of two FU Orionis (FUor) outbursts identified using the combination of the ground-based, near-infrared Wide-field Infrared Transient Explorer (WINTER) and the space-based, mid-infrared NEOWISE survey. Supplemented with near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up, we show that both objects are bona fide FUor type outbursts based on i) their proximity to star-forming regions, ii) large amplitude (2-4 magnitudes) infrared brightening over the last decade, iii) progenitor colors consistent with embedded (Class I) protostars, and iv) "mixed-temperature" infrared spectra exhibiting characteristic signatures of cool outer envelopes and a hot inner disk with a wind. While one source, WNTR24-cua, is a known FUor which we independently recover; the second source, WNTR24-egv, is a newly confirmed object. Neither source is detected in contemporaneous ground-based optical imaging, despite flux limits $\gtrsim 100\times$ fainter than their infrared brightness, demonstrating the capabilities of WINTER to identify heavily obscured young stellar object (YSO) outbursts. We highlight the capabilities of the Galactic Plane survey of the recently commissioned WINTER observatory in addressing the poorly understood FUor population with its unique combination of real-time detection capabilities, multi-color sensitivity, weekly cadence, and wide area coverage.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.04560v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Bars in low-density environments rotate faster than bars in dense regions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02054</link><description>arXiv:2511.02054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Does the environment of a galaxy directly influence the kinematics of its bar? We present observational evidence that bars in high-density environments exhibit significantly slower rotation rates than bars in low-density environments. Galactic bars are central, extended structures composed of stars, dust and gas, present in approximately 30 to 70 per cent of luminous spiral galaxies in the local Universe. Recent simulation studies have suggested that the environment can influence the bar rotation rate, $R$, which is used to classify bars as either fast ($1\leq R \leq1.4$) or slow ($R \gt 1.4$). We use estimates of $R$ obtained with the Tremaine-Weinberg method applied to Integral Field Unit spectroscopy from MaNGA and CALIFA. After cross-matching these with the projected neighbour density, $\log\Sigma$, we retain 286 galaxies. The analysis reveals that bars in high-density environments are significantly slower (median $R = 1.65^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$) compared to bars in low-density environments (median $R = 1.39^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$); Anderson-Darling $\textit{p}$-value of $p_{\mathrm{AD}}= 0.002$ ($3.1\,\sigma$). This study marks the first empirical test of the hypothesis that fast bars are formed by global instabilities in isolated galaxies, while slow bars are triggered by tidal interactions in dense environments, in agreement with predictions from numerous $\textit{N}$-body simulations. Future studies would benefit from a larger sample of galaxies with reliable Integral Field Unit data, required to measure bar rotation rates. Specifically, more data are necessary to study the environmental influence on bar formation within dense settings (i.e. groups, clusters and filaments).</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02054v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14065</link><description>arXiv:2601.14065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14065v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Maximal GW amplitude from bubble collisions in supercooled phase transitions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13402</link><description>arXiv:2509.13402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend analytic formulas for the gravitational-wave (GW) spectrum from first-order phase transitions to include cosmic expansion under the thin-wall and envelope approximations. We demonstrate that even for strongly supercooled transitions the GW amplitude is bounded from above. This conclusion is explicitly verified for several representative nucleation histories, including delta-function, power-law, and power-exponential types. Moreover, the spectral shape, amplitude, and peak frequency remain largely unaffected by the details of the nucleation rate once expressed in terms of the conformal variables evaluated at an appropriately defined characteristic collision time.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.13402v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Search for Radio Pulsations from Neutron Star Candidates in Detached Binaries</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2616</link><description>Recent optical astrometric and spectroscopic surveys have identified numerous neutron star (NS) candidates in nonaccreting detached binary systems, but their compact-object nature remains unconfirmed. In this work, we present targeted radio observations of 31 such candidates using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope, and the Shanghai TianMa Radio Telescope. Over a total of 46.65 hr of observing time, we detected neither periodic nor single-pulse radio emissions. These nondetections place stringent upper limits on the flux densities of any potential radio signals, reaching ∼4 μJy for periodic emission and ∼10 mJy for single pulses with FAST. Since our observations are highly sensitive and the flux density upper limits are well below the median fluxes of known Galactic pulsars, this suggests that geometric beaming is the most likely explanation for the nondetections if these objects are indeed pulsars. Alternatively, the NSs may be sufficiently old (≳10 Gyr) and have become intrinsically radio-quiet. In this case, our findings highlight the inherent difficulty of confirming NSs in such old detached binary systems through radio pulsation searches.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2616</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Observations of Electrostatic Solitary Waves in the Martian Magnetic Reconnection Exhaust Region</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3167</link><description>This study reports for the first time the occurrence of electrostatic solitary waves during a reconnection exhaust event observed by NASA’s Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission on 2015 February 9 in the dayside Martian magnetosheath region. A total of seven burst events were analyzed, showing that the peak amplitudes of most solitary structures lie in the range of 1–4 mV m−1, with pulse durations between 0.3 and 0.7 ms. The generation mechanism of these nonlinear waves is modeled by treating the reconnection exhaust region as an unmagnetized, multicomponent plasma composed of fluid H+, O+, , and ions along with background superthermal electrons. The Sagdeev pseudopotential technique is used to analyze solitary waves with arbitrary amplitude. The theoretical model predicts positive potential ion acoustic solitons having bipolar electric fields with amplitudes of (1.4–3.4) mV m−1 and having pulse durations of (0.3–0.5) ms, which are in good agreement with the observed values in the reconnection exhaust region.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3167</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Constraining the nHz Gravitational-wave Background with an X-Ray Pulsar-timing Array from NICER Observations</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae2ff5</link><description>We present constraints on the nHz gravitational-wave background (GWB) using X-ray pulsar-timing data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER).

We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of the three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in the free-to-shocked-stellar-wind environment of stellar-wind-blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that is characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways for studying both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation processes of jets through the envelope of the progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate that future observations by the Einstein Probe and SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of analogous events and further reveal information about progenitors and their circum-environments.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae34ab</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Pulsar Gleaners: Discovery of 19 Pulsars in FAST Archival Data at ∣b∣ &lt; 5° and Decl. &lt; −5°*</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3243</link><description>We report the discovery of 19 new pulsars identified from archival observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) within Galactic latitudes ∣b∣ &lt; 5° and declinations decl. &lt; −5°.

Our search employed fast Fourier transform (FFT)–based and fast folding algorithm (FFA)–based periodic searches and the single-pulse search. These new pulsars have spin periods ranging from 0.03 to 5.54 s. Two have periods under 0.1 s, suggesting they are likely young pulsars or mildly recycled pulsars. Four pulsars exhibit dispersion measures (DMs) exceeding 1000 pc cm−3, with PSR J1839–0558t having the highest value in our sample at ∼1271 pc cm−3, providing valuable samples for pulsar studies in the high-DM regime. Two rotating radio transients, PSRs J1836–0552t and J1847–0624t, were detected by FFA and single-pulse searches but failed with the FFT-based searches. In addition, three faint pulsars that were also missed by FFT-based searches were successfully detected using FFA. These discoveries demonstrate the critical role of FFA in uncovering faint, long-period, and sporadic pulsars and highlight the significant potential of FAST archival data, especially when combined with longer integration times and complementary search techniques, to reveal rare and weak pulsar populations.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae3243</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles] Matter-antimatter asymmetry in a rotating universe: Dirac spinors in axisymmetric Bianchi IX cosmology</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/djsl-k718</link><description>Author(s): Tatevik Vardanyan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The standard $\mathrm{Λ}$CDM model, based on a highly symmetric Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) geometry, successfully explains many observations but faces unresolved issues, motivating the exploration of alternative cosmological frameworks.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the Fast Radio Burst (FRB) field has been accompanied by a simultaneous growth of FRB conferences. While these meetings are essential for interacting with other researchers and establishing collaborations, many remain only accessible to those with substantial travel funding, flexible schedules, or geographical proximity. This introduces barriers that predominantly affect early career researchers (ECRs) and people from under-resourced regions, limiting the growth, diversity, and sustainability of the community. To address these issues, the FRB 2025 conference, held in Montr\'eal in July 2025 with over 200 participants, was designed to prioritize inclusivity and accessibility alongside scientific excellence. In this work, we describe how we implemented these goals, including: organizing committees spearheaded by ECRs, a fully hybrid format including YouTube livestreams, low registration fees, a pedagogical day at the beginning of the conference, local vegetarian catering, and the implementation of flash-talks instead of posters. From a post-conference survey of participants, we were able to assess the effectiveness of our initiatives. Notably, we received very positive feedback from the online participants, which amounted to roughly half of the attendees, especially regarding the livestreams and talk recordings. The pedagogical day was also greatly appreciated. The low registration fees naturally led to challenges, in particular with the audio-visual management, and although areas for improvement were noted, such as poster sessions and support for attendees requiring visas, the conference was generally viewed as a success. Our experience demonstrates that highly accessible, hybrid conferences are possible within modest budgets ($\$20$k CAD), and we outline recommendations for future conferences, both in the FRB field and in other domains.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14357v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Fast X-ray transients in NuSTAR data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14375</link><description>arXiv:2601.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast X-ray transients (FXTs) are flashes of X-rays that last for a few hundreds of seconds to a few hours. An enigmatic population of these transients that did not have a clear origin has been known for several decades, mostly found serendipitously in soft X-ray imaging observations. Recent progress in this field by Einstein Probe has found that many FXTs are associated with gamma-ray bursts and the collapse of massive stars. Motivated by this, we searched the NuSTAR archive in the harder 3--79 keV band for $\sim1000$ s duration transients. From 204 Ms of exposure we present five candidate FXTs, four of which are spectrally hard, with power-law indices $-3&lt;\Gamma&lt;0$, standing them apart from FXTs discovered in the soft band. Three have potential associations with galaxies at $z=0.1-2$, implying 3--79 keV luminosities of $10^{43}$ to $10^{48}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and volumetric event rates of 125--2900 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$. The properties of these NuSTAR FXTs most resemble low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts, and would be much more common than their higher-luminosity counterparts in this redshift range.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14375v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] MeV absorption in gamma-ray bursts as a probe of their progenitor winds</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14393</link><description>arXiv:2601.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A small fraction of X-ray photons from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), after escaping the relativistic jet, are scattered by electrons in the circumburst medium. Subsequent photon-photon absorption between the incoming MeV $\gamma$-rays and the back-scattered X-rays generate electron-positron pairs, enriching the surrounding medium with leptons. We investigate how these back-scattered photons modify the prompt GRB spectrum through $\gamma-\gamma$ absorption. In a dense and pair-loaded wind environment, the emerging spectra exhibit a broad attenuation structure, whose morphology is sensitive to the low-energy spectral index $\alpha$. In particular, spectra with $\alpha &gt; -1$ develop a pronounced, saddle-shaped absorption between 1 and 100 MeV (rest frame). Such external MeV absorption could account for the spectral curvature seen in some bright GRBs, and may point to enhanced mass loss from their progenitor stars, consistent with early observations of core-collapse supernovae.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14393v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Role of Inner Halo Angular Momentum (Spin) in Shaping Dark Matter Bars in Milky Way Analogs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14420</link><description>arXiv:2601.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of galactic bars have primarily focused on stellar bars, since they can be directly observed through ultraviolet to infrared wavebands. Cosmological as well as idealised simulations reveal that the dark matter (DM) haloes interact with baryonic matter, primarily the stellar bars, dynamically by means of the exchange of angular momentum. In these simulations, the spherical DM halo dynamically responds to interaction with the stellar bar by reshaping its orbital structure in the proximity of the stellar bar, forming a bar-like configuration, called as the Dark Matter (DM) bar. Using N-body simulations of Milky Way analogs we discuss the role of inner halo angular momentum, measured as halo spin parameter {\lambda} of the dark matter halo, on formation and evolutionary characteristics of the DM bars. Our systematic study involves haloes with initial spin configurations ranging from {\lambda} = 0 to 0.1. The result conveys that DM bar formation and its characteristics are extensively dependent on the initial spin parameter {\lambda} of the DM halo. We demonstrate that the strength of the dark matter bar gradually increases with an increase in halo spin in long-term evolution, with a significant impact of stellar bar buckling on dark matter bar strength. The evolutionary characteristics of the DM bar are strongly influenced by the initial spin of the host halo.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14420v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Prospects of Prompt Gamma-Ray Burst Polarimetry with POLAR-2</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14481</link><description>arXiv:2601.14481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant radiation mechanism that powers the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains poorly understood. High quality, time- and energy-resolved linear polarization measurements of prompt $\gamma$-ray photons can distinguish between synchrotron and inverse-Compton processes and provide crucial constraints on the outflow properties. This will be achieved by POLAR-2 that is proposed as a dedicated GRB polarimeter and successor to POLAR. The High-energy Polarimetry Detector (HPD) is one of the three instruments of POLAR-2 that features significantly improved sensitivity in the $(40-1000)$\,keV energy range and a detection area four times larger than that of POLAR. Here we demonstrate the capabilities of the HPD to constrain key physical model parameters by creating and fitting to synthetic sources using a time-resolved spectro-polarimetric theoretical model of prompt GRB emission. The time-resolved spectral and polarization fits are performed using a novel technique featuring maximum likelihood over an unbinned (in time and energy) list of detected events. The constrained model parameters directly relate to the underlying source physics that would reveal an accelerating, coasting or decelerating emission region. For a pulse fluence of $\mathcal{F}=10^{-5}\mathcal{F}_{-5}\,{\rm erg\,cm^{-2}}$ we can constrain the time-integrated polarization degree to an absolute accuracy ($1\,\sigma$) of about $2.5\mathcal{F}_{-5}^{\,-1/2}$ per cent, as long as source photons dominate over the background. In bright GRBs, such unprecedented accuracy at these energies will allow to distinguish between different models for the prompt GRB emission mechanism and constrain the magnetic field geometry, jet angular structure and outflow composition.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14481v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] IRMaGiC: Extending Luminous Red Galaxy Selection into the infrared with joint LSST and Roman HLIS Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14554</link><description>arXiv:2601.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IRMaGiC, an algorithm built based on RedMaGiC desgined to enhance the selection of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) across the redshift range $1 \leq z \leq 2$. We show that this method extends the capabilities of the redMaGiC algorithm by applying it to simulated photometric data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS). By integrating infrared band coverage from Roman HLWAS with LSST's optical bands, IRMaGiC enables red-sequence calibration at higher redshifts. We demonstrate that IRMaGiC reduces scatter and bias in photometric redshift estimates for LRGs at higher redshift, providing more accurate redshift assessments compared to existing methods. Our findings suggest that incorporating infrared data can considerably improve the selection and redshift estimation of LRGs at higher redshift, offering substantial benefits for future cosmological surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14554v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Decomposing the growth mechanisms of galaxies over the last 10 billion years</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14666</link><description>arXiv:2601.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining how galaxies accumulate stellar mass is paramount to understanding the Universe. Two primary mechanisms drive this process: star-formation (SF) &amp; mergers. Our understanding of star formation, and to some degree the processes that influence the baryon cycle (environment, gas supply, feedback, etc), are either relatively well constrained or will develop significantly over the coming decades via upcoming facilities (i.e. through their imprint on galaxy properties measured with deep multi-wavelength and spectroscopic data). However, the same can not be said for mergers. It is telling that we indirectly know hierarchical assembly through mergers is one of the most crucial processes that shape our Universe, but the robust observational measurement of mergers is almost non-existent outside of the local Universe - let alone how these mergers impact galaxy properties. This is not likely to significantly change in the coming decades as existing or approved facilities/surveys are inadequate in charactering mergers in the distant Universe. Motivated by this, we discuss an ambitious study to first explore mergers, and then the co-dependent astrophysical process that govern the accumulation of stellar mass over the last ~10billion years, and highlight the essential need for a 10m+ class multi-object spectroscopic facility.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14666v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Evidence of mutually exclusive outflow forms from a black hole X-ray binary</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14762</link><description>arXiv:2601.14762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion onto black holes often leads to the launch of outflows that significantly influence their surrounding environments. The two primary forms of these outflows are X-ray disk winds-hot, ionized gases ejected from the accretion disk-and relativistic jets, which are collimated streams of particles often expelled along the rotational axis of the black hole. While previous studies have revealed a general association between spectral states and different types of outflows, the physical mechanisms governing wind and jet formation remain debated. Here, using coordinated NICER and MeerKAT observations of the recurrent black hole X-ray binary 4U 1630-472, we identify a clear anti-correlation between X-ray disk winds and jets: during three recent outbursts, only one type of outflow is detected at a time. Notably, this apparent exclusivity occurs even as the overall accretion luminosity remains within the range expected for a standard thin disk, characteristic of the canonical soft state. These results suggest a competition between outflow channels that may depend on how the accretion energy is partitioned between the disk and the corona. Our findings provide new observational constraints on jet and wind formation in X-ray binaries and offer a fresh perspective on the interplay between different modes of accretion-driven feedback.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14762v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Numerical study of multiple solar flare induced modulation of Very Low Frequency (VLF) diurnal profile</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14948</link><description>arXiv:2601.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's ionosphere is a perpetual detector of ionizing radiation received from celestial objects, particularly the Sun. Solar ionizing radiation in the form of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-rays during both quiet and active phase of the Sun, and charged particles associated with a solar wind imprint their ionization signatures on the ionosphere. Although due to the bipolar nature of the geomagnetic field, the events, such as the solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated solar wind enhancement, usually disturb the polar ionosphere only, the UV and X-rays from the solar flares produce sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) in low-mid-latitude part of the earth's ionosphere. Such ionospheric disturbances are studied with the help of the influence they exert on radio waves propagating through earth-ionosphere waveguide. For the lower part of the ionosphere, called the D region, prominent modification in electron-ion density during solar flares can be observed via deviation in earth bound Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave signal from its ambient diurnal profile. In earlier work, successful model of the deviation in VLF amplitude due to different classes of solar flares was formulated. There, calculation of rate of ionization with Monte Carlo simulation and ion-chemistry evaluation of plasma density enhancement followed by a radio propagation simulation was used. Presently, we attempt to numerically reconstruct the modulation in VLF signal from its diurnal pattern produced by multiple solar flares occurring over a single day. Successful reconstruction of the VLF signal modulation for such a complex flaring scenario points to the accuracy of our understanding of the ionization effect due to solar activity on the lower ionosphere, and strengthen our claim to use earth's ionosphere as a high energy space transient event detector.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14948v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] How a Close-in Planet Protects its White Dwarf Host from Pollution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15005</link><description>arXiv:2601.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximately 25-50% of white dwarfs (WDs) exhibit metal absorption lines in their photospheres, which are attributed to accretion from their remnant planetary systems. Although white dwarfs with detected planetary systems are more likely to show photospheric pollution, one notable exception - WD 1856+534 - hosts a close-in giant planet yet exhibits no detectable photospheric metal pollution. Previous studies have proposed that massive, close-in planets can block inward transport of small particles driven by radiative forces (e.g., Poynting-Robertson drag and the Yarkovsky effect). However, it remains unclear whether the close-in planet can similarly prevent delivery of larger bodies via dynamical interactions. We aim to quantify the protective influence of close-in planets on white-dwarf pollution by asteroids approaching on near-parabolic orbits, and to explore the planetary masses and orbital separations required to provide effective protection. We perform ensembles of short-term N-body integrations, sampling a range of planet masses and orbital separations and initializing asteroids on highly eccentric orbits with periapses near the WD Roche radius, in order to measure scattering, capture, and ejection outcomes and quantify the planet's shielding efficiency. For WD1856+534b-like configurations (a_p = 0.02 au), giant planets with masses greater than 0.5 Jupiter masses are sufficient to clear over 80% of highly eccentric small-body contaminants. The effectiveness of the protective effect diminishes with decreasing planetary mass and increasing semi-major axis. These findings help explain why some white dwarfs that host close-in giant planets do not show the photospheric metal pollution commonly observed in other systems.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15005v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of jet formation and propagation in self-gravitating collapsing stars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15030</link><description>arXiv:2601.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate collapsar models with and without self-gravity under identical initial conditions to directly compare the effects of self-gravity on jet properties, such as opening angle, jet power, terminal Lorentz factor, and its variability. We compute a suite of time-dependent, three-dimensional GRMHD simulations of collapsars in evolving spacetime. We update the Kerr metric components due to the growth of the black hole mass and changes its angular momentum. The self-gravity is considered via perturbative terms. We present for the first time the process of jet formation in self-gravitating collapsars. We find that self-gravity leads to temporary jet quenching, which can explain some features in the gamma-ray burst prompt emission. We find no substantial difference in jet launching times between models with and without self-gravity. We observe that in the absence of self-gravity, the jet can extract more rotational energy from the black hole, while self-gravitating models produce narrower jet opening angles. We show that under certain conditions, self-gravity can interrupt the jet formation process, resulting in a failed burst. Our computations show that self-gravity significantly modifies the process of jet propagation, resulting in notably different jet properties. We show that the timescales, variability, and opening angle of jet depend on whether self-gravity is included or not.

However, key parameters governing interstellar surface chemistry, such as diffusion energy barriers, remain poorly constrained. In particular, surface diffusion constitutes a fundamental step for the synthesis of complex organic molecules and plays a crucial role in understanding the desorption process. In this paper, the diffusion dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, representative of interstellar ices, is modeled with quantum-chemical methods. Employing a representative ensemble of water clusters, each made by 22 molecules, diffusion energy barriers between the binding sites are computed using Density Functional Theory. Diffusion rate coefficients are then determined by applying the harmonic approximation of Transition State Theory. The results, in agreement with experimental studies, revealed a wide distribution of diffusion energies. This reflects the intrinsic topological heterogeneity of ASW surfaces, and highlights how surface mobility significantly influences CO's desorption dynamics and, as a consequence, surface-mediated reactivity in interstellar environments. We show that key parameters commonly employed in astrochemical models, like the ratio between binding and diffusion energy, should be carefully revised.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15057v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Circumbinary Disk of HD 34700A: I.

Abstract: We present the first high-resolution ($\sim$ 0.14") Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum and CO molecular line emission observations of the quadruple system HD 34700. In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\rm{bin}}=4\,M_\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\alpha$ emission at 0.20" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\sim0.1\Delta\upsilon_{\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15262v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450</link><description>arXiv:2601.14450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14450v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Efficient prior sensitivity analysis for Bayesian model comparison</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15132</link><description>arXiv:2601.15132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian model comparison implements Occam's razor through its sensitivity to the prior. However, prior-dependence makes it important to assess the influence of plausible alternative priors. Such prior sensitivity analyses for the Bayesian evidence are expensive, either requiring repeated, costly model re-fits or specialised sampling schemes. By exploiting the learned harmonic mean estimator (LHME) for evidence calculation we decouple sampling and evidence calculation, allowing resampled posterior draws to be used directly to calculate the evidence without further likelihood evaluations. This provides an alternative approach to prior sensitivity analysis for Bayesian model comparison that dramatically alleviates the computational cost and is agnostic to the method used to generate posterior samples. We validate our method on toy problems and a cosmological case study, reproducing estimates obtained by full Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and nested sampling re-fits. For the cosmological example considered our approach achieves up to $6000\times$ lower computational cost.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.15132v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Exploring selection biases in FRB dispersion-galaxy cross-correlations with magnetohydrodynamical simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03258</link><description>arXiv:2506.03258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) of fast radio bursts (FRBs) in conjunction with their redshifts can be used as powerful probes of the distribution of extragalactic plasma. With a large enough sample, the free-electron--galaxy power spectrum $P_{eg}$ can be measured by cross-correlating FRB DMs with galaxy positions. However, a precise measurement of $P_{eg}$ requires a careful investigation of selection effects: the probability of both observing the FRB DM and obtaining a host galaxy redshift depends on their properties. We ray trace through the magnetohydrodynamic simulation IllustrisTNG to investigate the impact of expected observational selection effects on FRB dispersion--galaxy angular cross-correlations with a sample of 3000 FRBs at $0.3\leq z\leq 0.4$ . Our results show that cross-correlations with such an FRB sample are robust to properties of the FRB host galaxy: this includes DM contributions from the FRB host and optical follow-up selection effects. We also find that such cross-correlations are robust to DM-dependent and scattering selection effects specific to the CHIME/FRB survey. However, a DM-dependent selection effect that cuts off the 10\% most dispersed FRBs at a fixed redshift shell can bias the amplitude of the cross-correlation signal by over 50\% at angular scales of $\sim 0.1^\circ$, corresponding to $\sim$ Mpc physical scales. Our findings highlight the importance of both measuring and accounting for selection effects present in existing FRB surveys, as well as mitigating DM-dependent selection effects in the design of upcoming FRB surveys aiming to probe large-scale structure with FRBs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.03258v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338</link><description>arXiv:2510.16338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.16338v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The FAST-SETI Milky Way Globular Cluster Survey I: A Pilot Multibeam On-the-Fly Search of Five Globular Clusters at L-Band</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21085</link><description>arXiv:2511.21085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| &lt;= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt;= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.21085v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Enhanced detection limits in the SHINE F150 survey through the Regime Switching Model.

Abstract: In high-contrast imaging, a novel detection algorithm for angular differential imaging (ADI) sequences has recently been introduced: the Regime Switching Model (RSM). In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.01511v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The effects of star-gas interactions on binary evolution in open clusters</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01597</link><description>arXiv:2601.01597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star-gas interactions can provide gravitational feedback that influences the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters, through processes such as dynamical friction (DF) and its non-dissipative counterpart, negative dynamical friction (NDF). Using the \texttt{PeTar} code, we perform direct $N$-body simulations of an open cluster initially containing $10^4$ stars, evolving within a gaseous medium spanning a range of ambient densities. Our results demonstrate that NDF associated with stellar outflows interacting with the surrounding gas can enhance the rate of cluster expansion, preferentially transporting stars toward the cluster outskirts. This behavior is accompanied by a more rapid decline in the number of binaries composed of a neutron star and a main-sequence star. A statistical analysis of binary orbital parameters further indicates that, compared to DF-dominated evolution, NDF tends to retain systems with larger semi-major axes and lower eccentricities. Outflow-ambient gas interactions can modify the dynamical processing of binaries in star clusters, leading to changes in the survival fraction and composition of the remaining binary population.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.01597v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cluster number counts in dark energy model with energy and momentum coupling to dark matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11270</link><description>arXiv:2601.11270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The influences on the cluster number counts from the coupling between dark energy and dark matter with momentum transfer are investigated. We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11270v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Observational Signatures of Planetary Tidal Disruption Events Around Solar-Mass Stars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12501</link><description>arXiv:2601.12501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal disruption of planets by their host stars represents a growing area of interest in transient astronomy, offering insights into the final stages of planetary system evolution. We model the hydrodynamic evolution and predict the multi-wavelength observational signatures of planetary TDEs around a solar-mass host, focusing on Jupiter-like and Neptune-like progenitors and examining how different eccentricities of the planet's pre-disruption orbit shape the morphology and emission of the tidal debris. We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the FARGO3D code to model the formation and viscous evolution of the resulting debris disk. We employ a viscous alpha-disk prescription and include a time-dependent energy equation to compute the disk's effective temperature and subsequently derive the bolometric and multi-band photometric light curves. Our simulations show that planetary TDEs produce a diverse range of luminous transients. A Jupiter-like planet disrupted from a circular orbit at the Roche limit generates a transient peaking at $L_{bol} \approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after a 12-day rise. In contrast, the same planet on an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) produces a transient of comparable peak luminosity but on a much shorter timescale, peaking in only 1 day and followed by a highly volatile light curve. We find that the effect of eccentricity is not universal, as it accelerates the event for Jupiter but delays it for Neptune. A robust "bluer-when-brighter" colour evolution is a common feature as the disk cools over its multi-year lifetime. The strong dependence of light curve morphology on the initial orbit and progenitor mass makes these events powerful diagnostics. This framework is crucial for identifying planetary TDEs in time-domain surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12501v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Studying Ionospheric Phase Structure Functions Using Wide-Band uGMRT (Band-4) Interferometric Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08823</link><description>arXiv:2507.08823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of the low-frequency radio sky ($&lt;$ 1~GHz) are largely limited by systematic effects introduced by the ionosphere. In this study, we use a ten-hour nighttime observation of the bright radio source 3C48, carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), to examine how ionospheric conditions affect radio signals. We focus on measuring phase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere and analyse how these variations change with antenna separation using the spatial phase structure function. Our results, based on data from three sub-bands between 575 and 725~MHz, show a clear power-law trend consistent with turbulent behaviour. We introduce the diffractive scale as a scalar measure of ionospheric conditions, which could guide future calibration strategies. Furthermore, we find that the turbulence is anisotropic, with properties that vary by direction. The smallest diffractive scales do not always align with Earth's magnetic field, suggesting the influence of medium-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs). The contribution of these wave-like MSTIDs to the structure function follows a power-law with a slope close to 2.0, indicating their dominant role in shaping the observed anisotropic phase fluctuations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.08823v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Deep Andromeda JCMT SCUBA-2 Observations.

The 850 μm image with a ∼50 pc resolution yields a comprehensive catalog of 383 giant molecular clouds (GMCs) that are associated with the spiral arms. In addition, it unveiled a population of 189 compact interarm GMCs in M31, which are mostly unresolved or marginally resolved. The masses of all these GMCs are in the range of 2 × 104–6 × 106M⊙; the sizes are in the range of 30–130 pc. They follow a mass–size correlation, M ∝ Rc2.5. The interarm GMCs are systematically less massive, more diffuse, colder, and have lower star formation efficiency (SFE) than on-arm GMCs. Moreover, within individual spatially resolved on-arm and off-arm M31 GMCs, the SFE is considerably lower than the SFE in molecular clouds in main-sequence and green valley galaxies. Follow-up investigations on M31 GMCs may provide clues for how star formation may be quenched in galactic environments. Finally, we reconstrained the dust opacity spectral index β in the M31 galaxy by combining our new JCMT observations with archival Herschel and Planck data and found that the radial variation in β may not be as large as has been proposed by previous studies.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae21e1</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Inferring M BH–M bulge Evolution from the Gravitational-wave Background</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2480</link><description>We test the impact of an evolving supermassive black hole mass scaling relation (MBH–Mbulge) on the predictions for the gravitational-wave background (GWB).

We compare a semi-analytic model’s ability to reproduce the observed GWB spectrum with a static versus evolving-amplitude MBH–Mbulge relation. We additionally consider the influence of the choice of galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) on the modeled GWB spectra. Our models are able to reproduce the GWB amplitude with either a large number density of massive galaxies or a positively evolving MBH–Mbulge amplitude (i.e., the MBH/Mbulge ratio was higher in the past). If we assume that the MBH–Mbulge amplitude does not evolve, our models require a GSMF that implies an undetected population of massive galaxies (M⋆ ≥ 1011M⊙ at z &gt; 1).

Using emission-line data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the principal optical emission-line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous H ii region in M33. The excitation maps align well with the Hα morphology and are clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and secondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show substantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these variations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily caused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios. We present the Hα kinematics of the region and connect it to the excitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial distribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these excitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary nebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the overall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution spatial data.

However, direct observations of these shocks remain challenging due to their deep embedding within the ejecta and their small cooling layer. Hydro-radiative simulations with the RAMSES code taking radiative cooling into account are used to model the evolution of DSSs. Additionally, an analytical framework is developed to validate simulation results and predict key shock parameters. Simulations reveal significant cooling effects behind the forward shock, leading to strong density and temperature gradients. The analytical model successfully reproduces these results and enables a detailed parametric study, highlighting the influence of main parameters. Finally, using scaling laws, we miniaturize the DSS to a laboratory scale, preserving key dimensionless parameters that govern the DSS dynamics. By combining simulations, theoretical modeling, and scaling laws, this study paves the way for direct investigation of radiative shocks. It offers a unique opportunity to refine our understanding of astrophysical shock dynamics and validate current models.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae19e3</guid></item><item><title>[Publications of] Science with a Large Field-of-view Polarization Survey: The Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P)</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ae33f3</link><description>Optical polarimetry provides information on the geometry of the emitting region, the magnetic field configuration and the properties of dust in astrophysical sources. Current state-of-the-art instruments typically have a small field of view (FoV), which poses a challenge for conducting wide surveys. We propose the construction of the Large Array Survey Telescope Polarization Node (LAST-P), a wide-field array of optical polarimeters. LAST-P is designed for high-cadence (≲1 day) polarization monitoring of numerous astrophysical transients, such as the early phases of gamma-ray bursts, supernovae, and novae. Furthermore, LAST-P will facilitate the creation of extensive polarization catalogs for X-ray binaries and white dwarfs, alongside a large FoV study of the interstellar medium. In survey mode, LAST-P will cover a FoV of 88.8 deg2. With a 15 ×1 minutes exposure, the instrument will be capable of measuring polarization of sources as faint as Gaia Bp-magnitude ∼20.9. The precision on the linear polarization degree will reach 0.7%, 1.5%, and 3.5% for sources with magnitudes 17, 18, and 19, respectively, for a seeing of 2 7, air mass of about 1 for observations in dark locations.

Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV γ-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV e± in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from X-rays to soft γ-rays, produced by the DM induced e± via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing X-rays, γ-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope Cosi, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of 〈σv〉 ≲ 10-27 cm3/s, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like Cosi, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description><author>Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1475-7516/2026/01/038</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles] Mesoscopic Rough Electrical Double Layers</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/bwdx-3yf3</link><description>Author(s): Weiqiang Tang, Jinwen Liu, Katharina Doblhoff-Dier, and Jun Huang&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamental understanding of electrical double layers (EDL) has been gleaned mostly on ideally planar electrodes, while realistic electrodes usually exhibit surface roughness on multiple scales.

Abstract: We present a catalog of 643 diffuse galaxies identified through a citizen science search of the Fornax cluster, of which we estimate 21.8% are nucleated (139/637; 6 inconclusive). This marks the first crowd-sourced effort to construct a cluster-scale census of diffuse galaxies. These objects were visually identified using a combination of the Fornax Deep Survey and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey imaging across 26 deg$^2$. Over 1,400 volunteers cataloged the candidates within this sky area at a rate of 1.15 days/deg$^2$. Our catalog is highly complete relative to existing dwarf catalogs of Fornax ($&gt; 80\%$ of objects recovered) down to an effective radius $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 5^{\prime \prime}$, the minimum size we suggested volunteers classify, and to an effective r-band surface brightness as faint as $\langle \mu_r \rangle \simeq26$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We detect 97 candidates that existing automated searches of Fornax did not find and three candidates not found by any prior search, automated or visual. The stellar mass distribution of our sample is consistent with similar dwarf studies of Fornax, with the nucleated fraction peaking at 80% for a host galaxy mass of $\sim$10$^{8.5}M_{\odot}$. The efficiency and completeness of our catalog thus establishes citizen science as a valuable tool for mapping diffuse galaxy populations in future sky surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11715v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Prediction of Multi-Wavelength Afterglows Associated with FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11887</link><description>arXiv:2601.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients with uncertain origins and environments. Recent studies suggest that some active FRBs may originate from compact objects in binary systems. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework to model the multi-wavelength afterglows of FRBs resided in binary systems and apply it to two representative repeaters, FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A. By solving the dynamics and radiation processes of FRB ejecta interacting with the surrounding medium, we compute afterglow light curves in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. Our results show that radio afterglows offer the best prospects for detection, with their brightness highly sensitive to ejecta kinetic energy and ambient density. Future high-sensitivity radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), could detect these signals. Optical afterglows, though short-lived and challenging to observe, may be significantly enhanced in dense environments, potentially making them detectable with facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In contrast, X-ray afterglows are predicted to be too faint for detection with current instruments. Our study highlights the potential of multi-wavelength afterglows as probes of FRB progenitors and their surrounding environments, offering crucial insights into the nature of these mysterious transients.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11887v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Possible Multi-band Afterglows of FRB 20171020A and its Implication</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11889</link><description>arXiv:2601.11889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of mysterious origin, with growing evidence linking at least some of them to magnetars. While FRBs are primarily observed in the radio band, their potential multi-wavelength afterglows remain largely unexplored. We investigate the possible afterglow of FRB 20171020A, a rare nearby and bright FRB localized in a galaxy at only 37 Mpc. Assuming that this source produces a future bright burst, we model the expected afterglow emission in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands under both uniform and wind-like ambient media, within the framework of the magnetar model. Our results show that the optical afterglow is the most promising for detection, but it fades rapidly and requires follow-up within a few hundred seconds post-burst. The radio afterglow may be detectable under favorable conditions in a dense stellar wind, whereas the X-ray counterpart is too faint for current telescopes. These findings suggest that rapid optical follow-up offers the best opportunity to detect the afterglow of the next bright burst from FRB 20171020A, providing unique insights into the progenitor and its environment. To assess observational feasibility, we estimate the event rate of nearby FRBs with sufficient energy to power detectable afterglows, finding a rate of $\sim$0.3 per year for CHIME surveys. Although this rate is low and the optical detection timescale is short, coordinated fast-response strategies using global telescope networks could significantly improve the chance of success. As more nearby FRBs are discovered, multi-wavelength observations will be essential in unveiling the physical nature of these enigmatic events.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11889v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search.

Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) are critical tracers of intermediate- and high-mass star formation, yet their census remains incomplete compared to low-mass young stellar objects like T-Tauri stars. To expand the known population, we systematically searched for HAeBes in LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra. Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, identifying $\sim$240,000 spectra with potential H$\alpha$ emission. After removing contaminants (non-stellar objects, extragalactic sources, CVs, and Algol systems) and restricting to B/A-type stars, we obtained 1,835 candidates through 2MASS/WISE visual inspection. Spectral energy distribution analysis confirmed 143 sources with infrared excess ($J$-band or longer wavelengths), including 92 known HAeBes. From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the $(K-W1)_0$ vs. $(W2-W3)_0$ diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy $(K-W1)_0 \leq 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 \leq 1.1$, while other regions trace transition disks ($(K-W1)_0 &lt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &gt; 1.1$), globally depleted disks ($(K-W1)_0 &gt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &lt; 1.1$), and Class I/Flat/II HAeBes ($(K-W1)_0 &gt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &gt; 1.1$). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0,0) with semi-major axes of $a$=1.5, $a$=3.0, and $a$=4.0, and a semi-major to semi-minor axis ratio of 1.6:1.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12007v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Stability of equilibrium points in modified elliptic restricted three-body problem with various perturbation sources</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12026</link><description>arXiv:2601.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of the third body in an elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP) framework, taking into account perturbations from radiation pressure, oblateness, and elongation of the primary bodies, as well as disk-like structures. The objectives are to determine the positions and stability of the equilibrium points, asses how these points shift under the influence of perturbations, and evaluate the dependence of their stability on the orbital eccentricity and perturbation parameters. The ERTBP model is modified to include a radiating, oblate primary body and an elongated secondary body modeled as a finite straight segment, alongside perturbations from a surrounding disk. The system's equations of motion are numerically solved using parameters from perturbed and classical cases. Equilibrium positions are computed over a range of eccentricities and perturbation values, and stability is analyzed using linearized equations and eigenvalue methods. In all cases, we have found three collinear ($L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$) and two non-collinear ($L_4$, $L_5$) equilibrium points solutions. The inclusion of radiations, oblateness, elongation using a finite straight segment, and disk perturbation systematically displaces each equilibrium point from its classical location, with the magnitude and direction of the displacement varying with the perturbation parameter. Stability analysis confirms that the collinear points remain linearly stable under all tested conditions. Meanwhile, non-collinear points are stable under a specific condition. We investigate the stability boundary of these points as a function of orbital eccentricity and we found there is a critical range of eccentricity values within which stability is preserved.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12026v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Detection of a Millisecond Periodicity in BATSE Short Gamma-Ray Bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12108</link><description>arXiv:2601.12108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent oscillations at kilohertz frequencies have recently been detected in a small number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), suggesting quasi-periodic dynamics in their central engines. A prominent example is GRB~230307A, which exhibited a brief, highly coherent, energy-dependent periodic signal interpreted as the possible spin signature of a nascent millisecond magnetar formed after a compact binary merger. Motivated by these developments, we conducted a comprehensive search for similar signals, accounting for both temporal and spectral dependencies, in 532 short GRBs with time-tagged event data recorded by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) onboard the \textit{Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory}. Within this sample, we identify a single statistically significant case: GRB~960616 (BATSE trigger~5502), in which the $\sim$30~ms main emission episode is coherently modulated at 1100~Hz, with the strongest modulation above 320~keV and a fractional amplitude of $\sim$47\%. Assuming the presence of a coherent periodic modulation, we use data-driven Monte Carlo simulations to place an upper limit of $\sim$8\% on the fraction of the total radiated energy that can be modulated by the QPO. This event, exhibiting a periodicity at $\sim$0.91~ms, further supports the possibility that millisecond periodicities can arise during GRBs in merger-driven scenarios.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12108v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The MAGPI Survey: co-evolution of baryons and dark matter in star-forming disk-like galaxies at $0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12315</link><description>arXiv:2601.12315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the dark matter (DM) content and its structural dependence in star-forming disk-like galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$), utilizing spatially resolved kinematic data from the MAGPI survey. We report the following: (1) Low stellar mass galaxies ($M_{\rm star} &lt; 10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$) are strongly DM dominated across all radii, with average $\langle f_{_{\rm DM}} \rangle \sim 0.85$, while high-mass ($M_{\rm star} &gt; 10^{10.5}\, M_\odot$) systems exhibit relatively low DM fractions in their inner regions ($\langle f_{_{\rm DM}} \rangle \sim 0.47$) which is equivalent to local massive disk galaxies (e.g., Milky Way and Andromeda). This suggests a mass-dependent structural dichotomy, most-likely governed by a combination of internal galactic processes and environmental influences. (2) A tight inverse correlation between $f_{_{\rm DM}}$ and baryon mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm bar}$), with intrinsic scatter of $\sim 0.11$ dex. This is consistent with an inside-out baryon assembly scenario and suggests that the fundamental structural correlations of galaxies were already established by $z\sim 0.85$. (3) No significant evolution in $f_{_{\rm DM}}$ with redshift across the MAGPI window, and when combined with higher-redshift ($0.6 \leq z \leq 1.5$) data from Sharma et al. 2025, we quantitatively show that the reported decline in $f_{_{\rm DM}}(z)$ is most-likely due to observational biases against low-mass systems at $z &gt; 1$. These results offer empirical evidence for a scenario in which disk-like galaxies evolve through a co-regulated build-up of baryonic and DM components, preserving internal structural regularities (such as the total mass distribution and rotation-curve shape) throughout cosmic time.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12315v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Unveiling the First O-Type Bloated Star Candidate through ALMA and EVLA Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12336</link><description>arXiv:2601.12336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the circumstellar environment of the O-type bloated star candidate IRAS 19520+2759 (I19520) using high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA).

Abstract: The tidal disruption of planets by their host stars represents a growing area of interest in transient astronomy, offering insights into the final stages of planetary system evolution. We model the hydrodynamic evolution and predict the multi-wavelength observational signatures of planetary TDEs around a solar-mass host, focusing on Jupiter-like and Neptune-like progenitors and examining how different eccentricities of the planet's pre-disruption orbit shape the morphology and emission of the tidal debris.We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the FARGO3D code to model the formation and viscous evolution of the resulting debris disk. We employ a viscous alpha-disk prescription and include a time-dependent energy equation to compute the disk's effective temperature and subsequently derive the bolometric and multi-band photometric light curves.Our simulations show that planetary TDEs produce a diverse range of luminous transients. A Jupiter-like planet disrupted from a circular orbit at the Roche limit generates a transient peaking at $L_{bol} \approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after a 12-day rise. In contrast, the same planet on an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) produces a transient of comparable peak luminosity but on a much shorter timescale, peaking in only 1 day and followed by a highly volatile light curve. We find that the effect of eccentricity is not universal, as it accelerates the event for Jupiter but delays it for Neptune. A robust "bluer-when-brighter" colour evolution is a common feature as the disk cools over its multi-year lifetime. The strong dependence of light curve morphology on the initial orbit and progenitor mass makes these events powerful diagnostics. This framework is crucial for identifying planetary TDEs in time-domain surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.12501v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The long-term evolution of Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxies and observational implications</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13049</link><description>arXiv:2601.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. In the Local Group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) exhibit large velocity dispersions. These values are generally attributed to the presence of substantial amounts of dark matter (DM), in line with the predictions of the standard model of galaxy formation. However, alternative, more conservative explanations exist, such as non-virialized dynamical states induced by tidal interactions, the presence of stellar streams, and artificial inflation of the velocity dispersion caused by binary-star orbital motion. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of UFDs using purely stellar ("dry") dynamics, without invoking DM. We dynamically evolve our systems up to a Hubble time and compare our results with observational studies and previous theoretical work. Methods. We employ direct high precision NBODY simulations performed with the NBODY6++GPU code. We explore the role of binaries in inflating the velocity dispersion of low-mass host galaxies. We also present both the stellar and dynamical evolution of the stellar population, which is necessary to properly interpret our results. Results. We find that, in all our models, the UFD remains globally quasi-stationary for approximately 3000 Myr. Subsequently, the system undergoes mass segregation and experiences a phase resembling core collapse. Red giants and white dwarfs (WD) are found to play significant, but distinct, roles. Red giants provide the dominant contribution to the luminosity, whereas WDs constitute the largest fraction of the non-luminous component, accounting for approximately 13% of the total stellar population. Finally, if not taken into account properly, velocity dispersion measurements can be strongly biased by the presence of a significant binary population, which can lead to substantial overestimates of velocity dispersion in UFDs</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13049v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Simulating the quasi-ballistic regime of a short Gamma-Ray Burst jet</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13056</link><description>arXiv:2601.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study extends the 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a jet emerging from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger presented in Pavan et al. (2023), in which an incipient jet was manually injected into the realistic environment imported from a previous general-relativistic MHD simulation of a merging BNS system. The jet evolution is followed up to almost 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Our results reveal that the jet faces challenges in penetrating the dense surroundings, leading to a barely successful outflow that exhibits structural asymmetries and low Lorentz factors. By the end of the extended simulation, 98% of the jet energy is converted to kinetic form and its angular structure is stabilized. The physical quantities inferred thus provide reliable inputs for afterglow emission calculations. This work demonstrates a method for simulating jets in 3D up to nearly ballistic regimes that is general and ready to be applied to any jet in a BNS merger context.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13056v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Tidal capture and repeating partial tidal disruption events of giant stars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13113</link><description>arXiv:2601.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass -- lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13113v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Broadband Variability Analysis of FSRQ PKS\,0402-362 with Indications of Quasi-Periodic Modulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13181</link><description>arXiv:2601.13181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS~0402$-$362 using \textit{Fermi}-LAT/Swift-XRT/UVOT observations spanning from MJD 54686-60321. The $\gamma$-ray light curve exhibits multiple phases of enhanced activity, with the fractional variability parameter ($F_{\mathrm{var}}$) showing larger amplitudes at longer timescales, consistent with variability trends observed in other FSRQs. Statistical analysis of the flux and spectral index distributions using the Anderson--Darling test and histogram fitting reveals that both distributions deviate from a single log-normal form and are better represented by a double log-normal profile, indicating two distinct flux states. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\gamma$-ray emission using the Lomb--Scargle periodogram identified a significant periodic signal at $\sim$413~days with a confidence level exceeding $3\sigma$. However the proximity of the timescale to one year and limited number of observed cycles prevents a definitive interpretation. Broadband spectral energy distributions for six flux states were modeled using a one-zone leptonic framework incorporating synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), and external Compton (EC) components. The SEDs are well reproduced with physically reasonable parameters: high-flux states exhibit harder electron spectra and lower magnetic field strengths ($B \sim 0.2--0.6\,\mathrm{G}$), while low-flux states show softer spectra and stronger magnetic fields ($B \sim 1.3\,\mathrm{G}$). The fitted break energy decreases during high-flux states, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling and a transition toward a particle- or kinetic-energy-dominated jet. These trends are consistent with the ``harder-when-brighter'' behavior commonly observed in blazars.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13181v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13200</link><description>arXiv:2601.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modeled via an $\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13200v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Galaxy transformation across the cosmic web: The influence zone of filaments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13309</link><description>arXiv:2601.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matter distribution in the Universe exhibits a rich variety of structures forming the cosmic web. These structures arise from the anisotropic gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations and define the pathways along which galaxies flow from voids to high-density clusters. Local density variations within these structures play a fundamental role in driving the environmental evolution of galaxies. To characterise filament boundaries, we analysed galaxy overdensity profiles around filaments in two redshift ranges: $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$ and $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$. Perpendicular and parallel profiles were derived by averaging galaxy overdensity as a function of distance. Characteristic scales and central overdensities were then analysed by fitting analytical models, specifically exponential and power-law families. We also introduced normalised density profiles to account for survey incompleteness. The perpendicular overdensity profiles show a nearly constant value in the central regions $D_{fila} &lt; 1$ Mpc, decreasing at distances up to $\approx 10$ Mpc. The mean physical widths (scale radii) at $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$ and $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$ are $2.39 \pm 0.69$ and $5.56 \pm 2.29$ Mpc, respectively. This scale difference between redshift ranges is also evident in the normalised profiles. Conversely, profiles along filaments remain constant at distances larger than $\approx 20$ Mpc from the nearest intersection. Our results show that the influence zone of cosmic filaments extends up to $\sim 10$ Mpc from their spines. Furthermore, a mild evolution in structural parameters is observed over the past $\sim 4$ Gyr, suggesting that filaments undergo measurable changes even at relatively low redshifts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13309v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Combined LOFAR-uGMRT analysis of the diffuse radio emission in the massive clusters Abell 773 and Abell 1351</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13316</link><description>arXiv:2601.13316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio halos are megaparsec-scale diffuse, non-thermal radio sources located at the centers of galaxy clusters, tracing relativistic particles and magnetic fields in the intra-cluster medium. Their origin is generally attributed to cluster mergers that generate turbulence and re-accelerate aged electrons. We study the diffuse radio emission, spectral properties, and the connection between thermal and non-thermal components in the massive galaxy clusters Abell 773 and Abell 1351 ($M_{500} \sim 7 \times 10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$), both of which are dynamically disturbed. We combine LOFAR LoTSS-DR2 observations at 144 MHz with uGMRT observations at 650 MHz, supplemented by archival XMM-Newton X-ray imaging. We confirm that both clusters host radio halos extending up to a largest linear size of $\sim 2$ Mpc. We measure an integrated spectral index $\alpha_{144}^{650} \sim -1.0$ for both clusters. The radio halo in Abell 773 resembles a classical halo and follows a sublinear radio--X-ray surface brightness relation. In contrast, Abell 1351 shows a more complex and asymmetric morphology, influenced by embedded radio sources including the brightest cluster galaxy, a tailed radio galaxy, and a ridge-like feature. These contaminating sources lead to deviations from the sublinear trend in the point-to-point radio--X-ray analysis of Abell 1351.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13316v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The DESIRED temperature-metallicity relations in star-forming regions: probing the Galactic radial and azimuthal metallicity distributions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13337</link><description>arXiv:2601.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a sample of 225 star-forming regions from the DESIRED-E project, each with simultaneous determinations of the electron temperature from ionized nitrogen and oxygen, $T_{\rm e}$([NII]) and $T_{\rm e}$([OIII]), respectively. We derive new empirical relations connecting the gas-phase metallicity to the global electron temperature, $T_{\rm e}$(H$^+$), as determined via radio observations. We establish two calibrations: one assuming a homogeneous temperature distribution ($t^2 = 0$, the ``direct method''), and another accounting for internal temperature fluctuations ($t^2 &gt; 0$). Applying these calibrations to 460 radio observations of Galactic HII~regions spanning Galactocentric distances from $\sim0.1$ to 16 kpc, we determine the radial O/H gradient in the Milky Way under both assumptions. We further compare these nebular gradients to independent metallicity estimates from young O- and B-type stars and Cepheid variables. We find that the $t^2 &gt; 0$ calibration yields a gradient in excellent agreement with stellar-based determinations, whereas the $t^2 = 0$ method underestimates metallicities by up to $\sim$0.3 dex. This discrepancy cannot be reconciled by invoking oxygen depletion onto dust grains or nucleosynthetic processing via the CNO cycle in massive stars. We also find that one widely used relation in the literature, assuming $t^2 = 0$, produces an excessively steep gradient -- likely due to the use of outdated atomic data and pre-CCD observations. Finally, we explore potential azimuthal variations in the Galactic metallicity distribution driven by the presence of the spiral arms, finding no evidence for variations larger than $\sim$0.1 dex with respect to the general radial gradient.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13337v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Environment and Gas Fraction in Type-2 AGN versus Non-AGN Galaxies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13375</link><description>arXiv:2601.13375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the environmental parameters and gas fraction (f$_{gas}$) properties of type~2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies, utilizing a large sample of galaxies from SDSS DR7 with z $\le$ 0.3. We find that the environment affects type~2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies in similar ways and does not impact the strength of AGN-driven outflows. The f$_{gas}$ of type~2 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies show no variation between group and isolated environments, suggesting that host galaxy gas content is largely independent of large-scale environment. We find that type~2 AGN host galaxies possess systematically lower f$_{gas}$ than their non-AGN counterparts when matched in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). This suggests that AGN activity plays a significant role in regulating the molecular gas reservoir and, consequently, the star formation processes within galaxies. We find that Type~2 AGNs exhibiting strong outflows are associated with higher gas fractions, higher star-formation rates, and younger stellar populations than those with weak or no outflows. This may indicate either concurrent star formation in gas-rich systems hosting powerful outflows, or a time delay between AGN activity and its effect on star formation consistent with a delayed AGN feedback scenario.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13375v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Magnetic field morphological diagnostics with ALMA in the G327.29 protocluster: VGT versus dust polarization</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13473</link><description>arXiv:2601.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields and turbulence may play a key role in the evolution of protoclusters, influencing the formation of dense cores and stars. Here, we examine the morphology of the magnetic fields in the G327.29 protocluster using both the velocity gradient technique (VGT) extracted from molecular line emissions and linear polarization in the dust continuum emission. The VGT analysis is performed using four molecular tracers: DCN (3-2), C18O (2-1), HN13C (3-2), and H13CO+ (3-2) - which probe gas across different density regimes, observed with the ALMA 12 m array. Owing to its sensitivity to gas dynamics, a comparison between VGT and dust polarization provides a powerful probe of the evolutionary processes in massive star-forming regions. From our analysis we reveal a complex magnetic-field structure, shaped by the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. In addition, it also appears that there is a large-scale (beyond the core scale) gravitational infall from the surrounding medium on to the filament and the central densest region. Furthermore, we observe that cores are dominated by a mix of turbulence and gravity. Overall, this work presents, likely for the first time, the application of VGT to a massive protocluster, G327.29, using high-resolution ALMA observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13473v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] c-C3H2 deuteration towards prestellar and starless cores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13495</link><description>arXiv:2601.13495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterium fractionation becomes highly efficient in cold, dense cores where CO is frozen out. Cyclopropenylidene (c-C3H2), an early-formed carbon ring, and its deuterated isotopologues trace gas-phase deuteration in these environments. We present a statistical study of c-C3H2 deuteration in starless and prestellar cores of the Perseus Molecular Cloud using observations of c-C3H2, c-C3HD and c-C3D2 obtained with the Yebes 40 m, ARO 12 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes towards 16 cores. Gaussian fits and RADEX modeling yield column densities for the detected species. c-C3H2 is detected in 14/15 covered cores, c-C3HD in 15/16, and c-C3D2 in 9/16. Derived column densities range from 0.5-8.1 x 10^{13} cm^{-2} for c-C3H2, 0.2-2.1 x 10^{12} cm^{-2} for c-C3HD, and 0.6-1.6 x 10^{11} cm^{-2} for c-C3D2. The ortho-to-para ratio of c-C3H2 is obtained for all but one core, with a median value of 3.5\pm0.4. Statistically corrected D/H ratios span 0.5-9.2% (median 1.5\pm0.2%), and D2/D ratios 9-55% (median 25.9\pm4.3%). No trend is found between the c-C3H2 ortho-to-para ratio and core evolutionary stage traced by n(H2). The median D/H ratio in Perseus appears lower than values reported for Taurus and Chamaeleon, while the D2/D ratio agrees with Taurus within uncertainties. A positive correlation between D/H and n(H2) supports the use of D/H as an evolutionary tracer. D2/D does not correlate with n(H2), but shows a positive correlation with T_{kin}, suggesting that its formation is influenced by a mildly endothermic pathway.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13495v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The R2Pub Telescopes for Surveying: An Overview and Performance Evaluation of the System</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13587</link><description>arXiv:2601.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R2Pub telescope, built by the Beijing Planetarium, is a 60 cm equatorial binocular telescope located at the Daocheng site of Yunnan Observatories in China, at an altitude of about 4700 m. This paper presents an overview of the R2Pub telescope system, including its design, instrumentation, and survey capabilities, and reports an initial evaluation of its system performance. R2Pub is a prime-focus binocular system, with each optical tube covering a field of view of approximately 18 square degrees. It is designed to detect a wide range of transient and variable sources in the local universe, such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, active galactic nuclei, and other unknown transients. The observatory infrastructure, including the dome, equatorial mount, optical tubes, and associated subsystems, has been fully constructed and installed, and the system has entered the commissioning phase. Benefiting from the high-altitude location, good seeing conditions, and dark sky background at the Daocheng site, performance tests during commissioning show that the R2Pub system can reach a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of about 18.7 mag in the Pan-STARRS r' band with a 60 s exposure. Ongoing observations with R2Pub are expected to contribute to studies of variable and transient phenomena and to enhance public outreach in astronomy. The binocular design enables simultaneous dual-band observations, providing instantaneous color information for transient sources and improving the classification and physical characterization of their properties and evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13587v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Joint constraints on cosmic birefringence and early dark energy from ACT, Planck, DESI, and PantheonPlus</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13624</link><description>arXiv:2601.13624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing number of high-precision astronomical observations, physical quantities that were previously inaccessible to accurate calculations, such as cosmic birefringence, have once again become a focal point of interest. Such phenomena induce a nonvanishing cross-correlation between the $E$- and $B$-mode polarizations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), thereby providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. The Chern-Simons coupling between the scalar field in early dark energy (EDE) models and CMB photons is regarded as a plausible mechanism for generating cosmic birefringence. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) deliver $EB$ measurements at higher multipole moments than those previously achieved by {Planck}, while DESI and PantheonPlus datasets provide new and stringent constraints on the late-time expansion history. Using a joint analysis of {Planck}, DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and ACT data, we perform a full-parameter constraint on the cosmic birefringence effects induced by the EDE-CMB photon coupling. Our results favor a higher Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.9^{+2.9}_{-2.5}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$, and a relatively large EDE fraction, $f_{\mathrm{EDE}} = 0.232^{+0.074}_{-0.047}$. By comparing the cosmological evolution of this model across different data combinations, we find that the ACT-$EB$ data combined with {Planck} + DESI + PantheonPlus provide good constraints to both early- and late-Universe observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13624v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Three-dimensional properties of a coronal shock and the longitudinal distribution of its related solar energetic particles</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13692</link><description>arXiv:2601.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the spatial-temporal evolution of shock properties and the longitudinal dependence of SEP intensities and spectra. The shock parameters, including the normal speed, oblique angles, compression ratio, and Alfven Mach number, were derived by combining a steady-state solar-wind simulation with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the shock surface based on multi-view observations. We compared the local shock parameters at the magnetic connecting points with in situ proton intensities and peak spectra to establish the link between shock evolution and SEP characteristics. The shock nose consistently exhibited higher particle-acceleration efficiency with the largest normal speed, compression ratio, and supercritical Alfven Mach number, while the flanks showed delayed transition to supercritical Alfven Mach number with weaker efficiency. The earliest and most rapid proton enhancement of STEREO-B correlated with efficient shock acceleration and prompt magnetic connectivity to the shock. Spectral analysis revealed that proton energy spectra were consistent with the relativistic diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) estimations. The initial shock acceleration began at about 1.4-5 Rsun and caused the widespread longitudinal SEP distribution. The longitudinal dependence of SEP intensity and spectral variations arise from the combined influence of 3D shock properties, magnetic connectivity, and particle transport processes. The agreement between in situ proton indices and relativistic DSA estimations supports DSA in this SEP event and provides insights into the early-stage acceleration at the source region.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13692v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A jet-gas interaction beyond the host galaxy: detection of a neutral hydrogen outflow at cosmic noon</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13728</link><description>arXiv:2601.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) observations of 0731+438, an \mbox{FR II} radio galaxy at a redshift of 2.429 with two lobes separated by 82 kpc. A blueshifted, faint and broad \mbox{H{\sc i}} 21 cm absorption line with velocity full width at half maximum (FWHM) $\sim 600\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ is detected against the southern radio lobe that is 47 kpc from radio core, indicating a neutral hydrogen outflow associated with jet-gas interaction beyond the host galaxy. The outflow has a mass outflow rate of $\sim\,0.4T_{\rm s}\Omega\rm\, M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, which could increase to $\sim\,4.0T_{\rm s}\Omega\rm\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to an energy outflow rate of $2.4T_{\rm s}\Omega\times10^{40}$ -- $1.5T_{\rm s}\Omega\times10^{41}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, where $T_{\rm s}$ is the spin temperature and $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the outflow. Previous optical observations identified an extended emission line region aligned with the radio axis, ionized by the central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Within this region, a warm and ionized outflow with a mass outflow rate of $\sim\,50\rm\, M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and an energy outflow rate of $\sim1.7\times10^{43}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ was detected. We propose that both the extended emission line region and the optical outflow are results of synergistic effect between jet and AGN radiation. The AGN likely exerts negative feedback on the host galaxy, as evidenced by the gas expulsion by the jet and the high velocity dispersion of ionized gas observed optically. So far, detections of jet-driven neutral hydrogen outflows remain rare. The high redshift, large outflow radii, substantial mass outflow rate and energy outflow rate of the neutral hydrogen outflow in 0731+438 expand the known parameter space of such outflows.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13728v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Still Accelerating: Type Ia supernova cosmology is robust to host galaxy age evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13785</link><description>arXiv:2601.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are a cornerstone of modern cosmology, providing first evidence for cosmic acceleration and new tests of dark energy. Son et al. 2025 (S25) claim a strong redshift evolution in standardized supernova luminosities driven by supernova progenitor age, with dramatic cosmological implications: rapidly evolving dark energy, decelerating expansion, and a $9\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda$CDM. We show that the underpinning evidence required for this conclusion -- the supernova progenitor-age dependence, the redshift-dependent age difference, and their combined impact -- is either negligible or relies on effects already corrected for in modern supernova analyses. First, the S25 analysis omits the standard host-galaxy stellar mass correction that captures known environmental dependencies that also correlate with stellar age. Applying this correction to the S25 sample, we find no dependence of standardized supernova brightness on host age. Independent data also show no significant difference at low-redshift in standardized brightness between star-forming galaxies and several Gyr older quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Second, the S25 scenario predicts strong redshift evolution of the host-mass effect. Data from the Dark Energy Survey supernova survey measure evolution of $-0.028 \pm 0.034~\mathrm{mag}\,z^{-1}$, consistent with zero and altering the dark-energy equation-of-state measurement ($w$) by $&lt;$0.01 if included. Third, we demonstrate that the claimed $\sim5$~Gyr progenitor age difference between nearby and distant supernovae is overstated by factors of three to five largely due to a conflation of host galaxy age with supernova progenitor age. We conclude that type~Ia supernova cosmology remains robust for current measurements of dark energy.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.13785v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14065</link><description>arXiv:2601.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14065v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Minutes-long soft X-ray prompt emission from a compact object merger</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14137</link><description>arXiv:2601.14137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact object mergers are multi-messenger sources and progenitors of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), primarily understood by gamma-ray observations, while poorly constrained in the prompt low-energy phase. A long-lasting X-ray emission was discussed as afterglows following several short-duration ($\lesssim$2 s) bursts, yet this prompt X-ray component was not directly observed or confirmed. Here we report the discovery of a minutes-long ($\sim$560 s) flash of soft X-rays immediately following the short ($\sim$0.4 s) GRB 250704B. The long-soft bump points to a distinct phase of prompt emission in X-rays detected by Einstein Probe in an event that otherwise appear as an ordinary short GRB, showing that long-lasting X-ray emission is likely a common feature of merger-driven bursts and a promising electromagnetic counterpart to gravitational-wave sources.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14137v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The PAIRS project: a global formation model for planets in binaries.

Abstract: Roughly half of Sun-like stars have at least one stellar companion, whereas it is widely assumed that most known exoplanets orbit single stars, largely due to observational biases. However, astrometric surveys, direct imaging, and speckle interferometry are steadily increasing the number of confirmed exoplanets in binaries. A stellar companion introduces additional effects, such as circumstellar disk truncation and gravitational perturbations, which can strongly impact planet formation. While global planet formation models, for example the Bern model, have been broadly applied to single stars, modeling S-type binaries requires key modifications to capture these effects. This study extends the Bern model by incorporating the gravitational influence of a stellar companion into its N-body integrator, allowing us to quantify how this perturbation affects planetary formation and final system architecture across a range of binary configurations. By comparing binary and single-star systems under identical initial conditions, we can assess the specific impact of binary-induced dynamics. We ran three sets of simulations: (i) a grid of in situ single-embryo cases to quantify gravitational effects; (ii) formation simulations with and without migration to compare outcomes with single-star analogs; and (iii) multi-embryo runs to evaluate impacts on multi-planetary systems. Planets forming beyond half the host star's Hill radius are much more likely to become unbound especially in systems with high binary eccentricity. Even within stable zones, growth is suppressed by both reduced material availability and increased eccentricity from stellar perturbations. Both disk truncation and stellar perturbations must be included to model planet formation in S-type binaries accurately. Neglecting either one will end up misrepresenting planetary growth and survival.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14215v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Probing AGN duty cycle and cluster-driven morphology in a giant episodic radio galaxy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14219</link><description>arXiv:2601.14219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of radio jet morphology and its energetics is significantly influenced by the environment in which the host galaxy resides. As giant radio galaxies (GRGs) often extend to the scale of entire galaxy clusters ($\sim$Mpc) and beyond, they are a suitable class of objects for studying jet--intracluster medium interactions. This paper presents a multiwavelength study of a GRG, J1007+3540, using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 400 MHz. The source has a projected linear extension of 1.45 Mpc and is hosted by MaxBCG J151.77665+35.67813, within the WHL 100706.4+354041 cluster. At both frequencies, the source exhibits clear signatures of recurrent jet activity, a one-sided, extended, tail-like diffuse structure with a morphological break in the tail. The estimated radiative ages of the inner lobes and outer north lobe are $\sim$140 Myr and $\sim$240 Myr, respectively. In addition to the radio analysis, we performed optical--to--infrared spectral energy distribution modelling. The host galaxy is an evolved elliptical system with a stellar mass of $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) = 11.0$ and an old stellar population age of $\sim$12 Gyr. The high infrared-derived star formation rate ($\sim106~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$) of the source implies significant dust-obscured star formation, potentially linked to merger-driven gas inflows. J1007+3540 presents a rare combination of a restarted jet, a detached tail-like structure, and unusual spectral flattening beyond the tail break, which is very rare to report together in a GRG. This rare and remarkable system offers a unique laboratory for probing the interplay between active galactic nucleus activity, star formation, and environmental effects in cluster-surrounded GRGs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14219v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A self-consistent explanation of the MeV line in GRB 221009A unveils a dense circum-stellar medium</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14257</link><description>arXiv:2601.14257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB~221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae. This provides a precious clue to the nature of the progenitor of this peculiar GRB, which could also be present in other bursts that feature a long quiescence followed by a bright emission episode with a hard spectrum.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14257v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Probing super-heavy dark matter with ultra-high-energy gamma rays</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11703</link><description>arXiv:2601.11703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We refine the constraints on the lifetime of decaying super-heavy dark matter particles (SHDM), with masses ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$ GeV, by analyzing ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray data. Our approach involves an accurate comparison of the primary gamma-ray emissions resulting from prompt SHDM decays in the galactic halo with the most recent upper limits on isotropic UHE gamma-ray fluxes provided by various extensive air shower experiments. We demonstrate that a precise consideration of the field of view and the geometric acceptance of different UHE gamma-ray observatories has significant implications for the inferred limits of dark matter lifetime. In addition, we examine the influence of uncertainties linked to the current models of the galactic dark matter distribution, employing diverse halo density profiles while varying both their radial extent and the local dark matter density. Our findings indicate that the newly established UHE gamma-ray constraints are marginally less stringent than earlier evaluations, thereby revisiting the SHDM parameter space and allowing for observable neutrino fluxes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11703v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Influence of Finite-Nuclei Constraints on High-Density Transitions and Neutron Star Properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14194</link><description>arXiv:2601.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct posterior distributions of the equation of state (EoS) for matter beyond the inner crust of neutron stars by incorporating finite nuclei (FN) constraints within relativistic mean field models. These constraints are implemented in three complementary ways: (i) through theoretical bounds on the EoS, (ii) implicitly via nuclear matter parameters, and (iii) explicitly by enforcing consistency with experimental binding energies and charge radii of selected nuclei. The resulting low-density nucleonic EoSs are subsequently matched to a model-agnostic speed-of-sound parametrization, constrained by astrophysical observations, including NICER mass-radius measurements, tidal deformability limits from GW170817, and lower bounds on the maximum neutron-star mass inferred from radio pulsar observations. We find that the admissible range of the transition density is strongly sensitive to the choice of the low-density EoS. In particular, the inclusion of explicit FN constraints significantly reduces the allowed parameter space of the nucleonic EoS at low densities, narrowing the transition-density range by nearly a factor of two. Consequently, neutron-star properties inferred from EoSs with explicit FN constraints differ substantially, with especially pronounced effects for low-mass neutron stars and their correlations with nuclear matter parameters. A quantitative comparison, using metrics based on Mahalanobis distance, shows consistency of the explicit constraints with PSRs J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and J0437-4715, but suggest a possible tension with PSR J0614-3329. These findings underscore the critical importance of a consistent treatment of finite-nuclei properties for reliably inferring the behavior of high-density matter and the presence of possible phase transitions from astrophysical observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.14194v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Halo Spin Depends on The Distance to Large-scale Filament</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11443</link><description>arXiv:2411.11443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a semi-analytical methodology to estimate the dark matter halo spin of HI gas-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey and investigate the relationship between halo spin and the proximity of galaxies to large-scale filaments. We exclude galaxies with low HI signal-to-noise ratios, those potentially influenced by velocity dispersions, and those affiliated with galaxy clusters/groups. Additionally, we apply a mass-weighting technique to ensure consistent mass distribution across galaxy samples at varying distances from filaments. Our analysis reveals, for the first time, a subtle yet statistically significant correlation between halo spin and filament distance in observational data, indicating higher spins closer to filaments. This suggests that the tidal forces exerted by filaments may impact the spin of dark matter halos.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.11443v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Bumblebee cosmology: Tests using distance- and time-redshift probes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18559</link><description>arXiv:2411.18559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern cosmology, the discovery of the universe's accelerated expansion has significantly transformed our understanding of cosmic evolution and expansion history. The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae calibrated via the SH0ES (Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State) Cepheid distance ladder analysis and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), as well as recently included cosmic chronometers (CC) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee models and compare them with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the bumblebee theory on its own can provide sufficiently good fits to the current observational data of distance- and time-redshift relations, suggesting its potential to explain the cosmic background dynamics. However, when compared to $\Lambda$CDM, the latter still outperforms the former according to the information criteria. We propose that further constraints from cosmological perturbation tests could impose more stringent constraints on bumblebee cosmology.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.18559v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 I: the recent starburst and launch of outflow in simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09452</link><description>arXiv:2412.09452v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the launch of the galactic outflow in M82 using hydrodynamic simulations. Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve star formation and feedback, avoiding reliance on simplified models. We investigate the effects of stellar feedback mechanisms, gas return from star-forming clouds, and disk mass on the starburst and outflow. Our simulations generate a starburst lasting $\sim25$ Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot},yr^{-1}}$, although the total stellar mass often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow develops in two stages: initially, continuous SNe form small bubbles that merge into a superbubble containing warm/hot gas and intermediate- to high-density cool filaments. After $\sim10$ Myr, the superbubble breaks out of the disk, and within $\sim15$ Myr a kpc-scale outflow forms. Cool filaments survive stellar feedback, become entrained in the wind, and stretch to hundreds of parsecs. Transport from the cool ISM is the dominant net contributor to the total mass of the cool phase in the outflow, whereas transfers from hotter phases, such as through condensation or precipitation, provide only a minor net contribution, likely offset by simultaneous transfer from the cool phase back to hotter phases. While the mass loading factor is comparable to M82, the cool gas outflow rate and velocity are lower, with velocities $\sim60\%$ below observed values; warm and hot gas are $\sim25\%$ slower. SN feedback is the primary driver, and gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow, while other factors are secondary. Stronger clustered SN feedback is likely required to better match observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2412.09452v4</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08077</link><description>arXiv:2507.08077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region (~1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases.
  MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to ~120 eV) trace outflowing material.
  The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions.
  Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet.
  For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.08077v4</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Three-Dimensional Numerical Simulations of Magnetar Crust Quakes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12567</link><description>arXiv:2508.12567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crust quakes are frequently invoked as a mechanism to trigger sudden transients in the magnetospheres of magnetars. In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\sim 1$~kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\sim 10 \ \rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since the seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfv\'en and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere. The results will be important for interpreting magnetar bursts and understanding the possible trigger mechanisms of fast radio bursts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.12567v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A HyperFlash and \'ECLAT view of the local environment and energetics of the repeating FRB 20240619D</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16374</link><description>arXiv:2509.16374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and \'ECLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($&gt;25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.27\pm0.13$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16374v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Light curves of time-dependent accretion disk in tidal disruption events</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16544</link><description>arXiv:2509.16544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescales of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which we apply to explain the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.16544v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Improved Radiative Transfer Corrections in Helium Emission Lines</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02045</link><description>arXiv:2510.02045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new detailed model of the He I collisional-recombination spectrum based on the most up-to-date atomic data. The model accounts for radiative transfer effects and the influence of a non-zero optical depth in He I lines arising from transitions to the metastable 2^3S state. The model reveals substantial deviations in the emissivities of the lambda3889 and lambda7065 lines in the case of a non-zero optical depth, with previous models systematically underestimating and overestimating them by 5 to 20 percent, respectively. In the optically thin case, however, our results show good agreement with previous studies. Using the new model, we compute optically thin emissivities for a wide set of UV, optical, and IR He I recombination lines over a fine grid of electron densities and temperatures typical for H II regions and planetary nebulae (1 &lt;= ne &lt;= 10^4 cm^-3, 8000 &lt;= Te &lt;= 22000 K). In addition, we present new fitting formulae for radiative transfer corrections for several He I lines relevant to optical and near-infrared observations, covering 0 &lt;= tau_3889 &lt;= 10 within the same density and temperature ranges. The accuracy of the obtained approximations is &lt;= 0.1 percent within the specified parameter range. These results can be readily implemented in modern codes for determining the primordial 4He abundance and are also applicable to a broader range of spectroscopic analyses of He I emission lines.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.02045v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939</link><description>arXiv:2510.06939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observation we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.06939v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cavendish experiment with fast radio bursts on cosmological scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11022</link><description>arXiv:2510.11022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key measure of gravity is the relation between the Weyl potential $\Psi+\Phi$ and the matter overdensity $\delta_m$, encapsulated as an effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm light}$ for light motion. Its value, along with possible spatial and temporal variations, is essential for probing physics beyond Einstein gravity. However, the absence of an unbiased proxy for $\delta_m$ prevents the direct measurement of $G_{\rm light}$. In this letter, we point out that the equivalence principle guarantees the dispersion measure (DM) of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a good proxy for $\delta_m$. We further propose an FRB-based estimator $F_G$ to directly measure $G_{\rm light}$, combining galaxy-DM of localized FRBs and galaxy-weak lensing cross-correlations. With a conservative cut $k\leq 0.1h$/Mpc, the measurement can achieve a precision of $\lesssim 10\% \sqrt{10^5/N_{\rm FRB}}$ over 10 equal-width redshift bins at $z\lesssim 1$. The major systematic error, arising from the clustering bias of electrons traced by the FRB DM, remains subdominant at the $5\%$ level. It can be further mitigated to the $\lesssim 1\%$ level, based on the gastrophysics-agnostic behavior that the clustering bias of total baryons (ionized diffuse gas, stars, neutral hydrogen, etc) approaches unity at sufficiently large scales. Therefore, FRBs shed light on gravitational physics across spatial and temporal scales spanning 20 orders of magnitude.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.11022v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Galactic bars and active galactic nucleus fuelling in the second half of cosmic history</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23522</link><description>arXiv:2510.23522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of galactic bars in fuelling and triggering Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to $z\sim 0.8$. We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE, quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity ($f_{\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\rm disc}$). We assess the impact of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that barred disc galaxies host a higher fraction of AGN compared to their unbarred counterparts, though the significance depends on the AGN selection method, with a more modest excess for SED AGN, and control sample size. This suggests a contributing role for bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host galaxy's emission ($f_{\rm AGN} &lt; 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.75$, independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\rm disc}$. Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars may contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.23522v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01859</link><description>arXiv:2511.01859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the "PUSH method", focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few "key reactions" that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.01859v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission as the Driving Mechanism in Long-Period Radio Transients</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15154</link><description>arXiv:2511.15154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPRTs) are highly polarised, coherent radio sources with periods of minutes to hours and bursts typically lasting 10 to 100 s. Here we consider the apparently isolated subclass of LPRTs and argue that electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) explains their narrow duty cycles and polarisation properties. In particular, we show that intrinsically circular ECME can emerge as predominantly linear after undergoing Faraday conversion in an overlying magnetospheric plasma layer, thus reconciling the observed high linear fractions with a circularly polarised maser. In this picture, a rotating oblique magnetosphere beams radiation into a thin, hollow emission cone whose surface lies almost perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The observed very narrow pulses arise when the line of sight skims the cone, while broader profiles and weak leading or trailing components occur when multiple azimuths along the emission ring meet the maser resonance condition. The observed isotropic-equivalent luminosities of about 10^30 to 10^31 erg s^-1 correspond to modest intrinsic powers once strong ECME beaming is taken into account. We show that such power levels can be supplied by accretion from the interstellar medium (ISM), and that detectability at kiloparsec distances favours slowly rotating neutron stars with comparatively low surface magnetic fields below about 10^10 Gauss and low space velocities.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.15154v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Explosions in the Empty: A Survey of Transients in Local Void Galaxies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15401</link><description>arXiv:2511.15401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events -- including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) -- in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.15401v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Machine-learning approaches to dispersion measure estimation for fast radio bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24003</link><description>arXiv:2512.24003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, mostly millisecond-duration transients of extragalactic origin whose emission mechanisms remain unknown. As FRB signals propagate through ionized media, they experience frequency-dependent delays quantified by the dispersion measure (DM), a key parameter for inferring source distances and local plasma conditions. Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.24003v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Triaxial Magnetars as Sources of Fast Radio Bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04953</link><description>arXiv:2601.04953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I suggest that some of the mysterious temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) may be explained if they are produced by dynamically triaxial magnetars. If the bursts are narrowly collimated along open field lines, then observed repeating FRB may be those in which the moment of inertia tensor is only slightly triaxial and the rotation axis, open field lines and radiation point nearly to the observer. Apparently non-repeating FRB may be triaxial with the direction of open field lines and radiation wandering across the sky, reducing their duty factors by several orders of magnitude. A slightly triaxial moment tensor in repeaters moves the line of sight into or out of the radiation pattern or within it, explaining periods of greater or lesser (or absent) activity, and making the probability of detecting a burst and hence the burst rate vary aperiodically. The dynamics of triaxial bodies might thwart the coherent integration of gravitational signals from rotating accreting neutron stars.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.04953v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Radiative Cooling Effects on Plasmoid Formation in Black Hole Accretion Flows with Multiple Magnetic Loops</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10968</link><description>arXiv:2601.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation in black hole accretion flows using 2D and 3D two-temperature GRMHD simulations with multi-loop magnetic fields. Our results show that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to a MAD state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon, modifies the disk structure via lower electron temperatures and increased equatorial density, and alters reconnection properties:compressing current sheets, shortening plasmoid lifetimes, and increasing their frequency. We also find enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere. These findings indicate that radiative cooling critically shapes both large scale accretion dynamics and small-scale reconnection phenomena, potentially modulating black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10968v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static and axisymmetric spacetimes: Local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link><description>arXiv:2504.07906v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static and axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic coefficient and a constant offset, which we express in terms of the coordinate-invariant curvature quantities evaluated at the unstable circular photon orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using the Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and the quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.07906v4</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03819</link><description>arXiv:2508.03819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV -- GeV scale have received significant attention lately. Pair-annihilations of such DM particles in the Galaxy can give rise to (at the same time) MeV to GeV $\gamma$-rays via prompt emission, sub-GeV $e^\pm$ in cosmic-rays, as well as a broad photon spectrum ranging from $X$-rays to soft $\gamma$-rays, produced by the DM induced $e^\pm$ via inverse Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation processes (collectively called `secondary emissions'). We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals. We compare our results with the constraints and (or) projections from cosmological and terrestrial observations. We find that, for both the sub-GeV DM models, the current observations constrain the annihilation cross-section at the level of $\langle \sigma v \rangle \lesssim 10^{-27} {\rm cm}^3/{\rm s}$, or lower for some specific mass ranges or under optimistic assumptions. Moreover, new unconstrained DM parameter space can be probed at the upcoming instruments like COSI, thanks to the inclusion of secondary photons which in many cases provide the dominant signal.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.03819v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Anderson self-localization of light in pair plasmas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20594</link><description>arXiv:2509.20594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization. The beat between the driver and a back-scattered wave creates charge-neutral, large random density fluctuations $\delta n/n_0 \gg 1$, and corresponding fluctuations of the dielectric permittivity $\epsilon$ (random plasma density grating). Propagating in quasi-1D, waves in a medium with spatially random self-created fluctuations of dielectric permeability experience localization. {In the linear regime, the instability can be classified as Induced Brillouin Scattering; it is described by the parameter $\rho _L = \left( a_0 { \omega_{p}/ }{\omega}\right)^{2/3} \leq 1 $, related to the Pierce parameter of Free Electron Lasers. In the cold case, the growth rate is $\Gamma \approx \rho _{L} \omega$ ($a_0 $ is laser nonlinearity parameter, $\omega_p$ is plasma frequency, $\omega$ is the laser frequency). } Anderson self-localization of light leads to (i) reflection of EM waves by the under-dense pair plasma; (ii) a wave already present inside the plasma separates into bright trapped pockets and dark regions. Mild initial thermal spread with $\Theta \equiv k_B T/(m_e c^2) \approx a_0^2$, restores wave propagation by suppressing the seeds of parametrically unstable density fluctuations. A circularly polarized driver produces linearly polarized structures, with position angle varying randomly between the bright pulses. Time-variability of the resulting density structures does not suppress localization due to remaining corrections (not white noise). We discuss possible applications to astrophysical Fast Radio Bursts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.20594v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Taxonomy of periodic orbits and gravitational waves in a deformed Schwarzschild black hole spacetime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00550</link><description>arXiv:2601.00550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.00550v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Effects of spontaneous Lorentz Symmetry breaking on Letelier-AdS charged black holes within Kalb-Ramond gravity</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10303</link><description>arXiv:2601.10303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10303v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Revisiting the 150 MHz Radio Luminosity Function of Star-forming Galaxies with LOFAR Deep Fields through a Refined Statistical Framework</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2474</link><description>We present a comprehensive analysis of the 150 MHz radio luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey in the ELAIS-N1, Boötes, and Lockman Hole fields. Our sample comprises ∼56,000 SFGs over 0 &lt; z &lt; 5.7. We first analyze the deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE). Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models—pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants—using a full maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts (SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian information criteria strongly favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C) provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges, whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of the LF, likely due to residual active galactic nucleus contamination. This study demonstrates that combining KDE with parametric modeling offers a robust framework for quantifying the evolving radio LF of SFGs, paving the way for future work with next-generation surveys like the Square Kilometre Array.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2474</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The ALMA Survey of 70 µm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES).

However, the universality of the CMF and its relationship to the initial mass function (IMF) remain unclear. We study the CMF in the earliest stage of high-mass star formation using 461 prestellar core candidates and 254 protostellar cores as a part of the ALMA Survey of 70 µm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of −2.05 ± 0.04, shallower than Salpeter’s IMF slope of −2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope (−2.32 ± 0.30), indistinguishable from Salpeter’s slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi–Hoyle–Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25f6</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Constraining the Properties of a GRB Accreting Magnetar with R/I Evolutionary Effects Using Swift/XRT Data</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2606</link><description>A newly born millisecond magnetar has been proposed as one possible central engine of some long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with X-ray plateau emission. In this work, we used a universal correlation between the initial spin period (P0) and the surface magnetic field (Bp) of the newborn magnetar based on an LGRB sample in L. Lan et al. (2025) to explore the propeller properties of accreting magnetars with R/I evolutionary effects. We found that the Bp–P0 relation is approximately consistent with . Here Peq is the equilibrium spin period in the magnetic propeller model, where the electromagnetic dipole radiation and the propeller mechanism jointly modulate the spin evolution of a newborn magnetar. The Bp–P0 relation indicates that P0 constrained by X-ray plateau data may not be the true initial spin period of a newborn magnetar but had reached an equilibrium spin period via fallback accretion in the propeller model. The magnetar accretion rate in our LGRBs is in the range of by incorporating R/I evolutionary effects and using the transition relation between gravitational mass Mg and baryonic mass Mb in different equations of state and X-ray radiation efficiencies. Such accretion rates ensure that the accreting magnetars in our sample survive until reaching the equilibrium spin period, and the accretion rate is one order of magnitude lower compared to the statistical results in G. Stratta et al. (2018) and W. L. Lin et al. (2020), which used the constant R/I/Mg scenario. The fallback rate of progenitor envelope materials onto the magnetar accretion disk for our LGRBs is compatible with the theoretical mass fallback rate of some low-metallicity progenitors. We suggested that adopting a constant R/I/Mg scenario for modeling the propeller regime in accreting magnetars results in a higher mass accretion rate, which may impair our understanding of the physical nature of an accreting magnetar and its surroundings, and that the low-metallicity progenitors can provide enough material to satisfy the accretion requirements of the newborn accreting magnetar in LGRBs.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2606</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] JCMT 12CO J = 3–2 Observations of Tycho’s Supernova Remnant: Constraints on the Environmental Gas Properties</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29f1</link><description>Recent observations suggest that Tycho’s supernova remnant (SNR; SN 1572) is expanding into a cavity wall of molecular clouds (MCs), which decelerate the SNR and influence its multiwavelength morphology. To constrain the physical properties of environmental MCs and search for heated gas, we perform a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope 12CO J = 3–2 observation and compare with previous 12CO J = 2–1, 12CO J = 1–0 and 13CO J = 1–0 data. We present the 12CO J = 3–2 map toward Tycho and show that the 12CO J = 3–2 spatial distribution and line profiles are similar to those of the lower-J CO lines. By comparing the multiple transitions of CO and the RADEX models, we constrain the physical properties of molecular gas surrounding Tycho: the northern cloud has a molecular column density of N(H2) = 0.5–4.5 × 1022 cm−2, while other regions have N(H2) = 0.2–3.9 × 1021 cm−2; the kinetic temperatures Tk of these clouds are in the range of 9–22 K, and the volume densities n(H2) are 20–700 cm−3. We also discuss the difficulty in finding hot molecular gas shocked by such a young SNR. We estimate that the shocked molecular layer can be as thin as 0.003 pc, corresponding to 0 2 at the distance of 2.5 kpc, which is 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the angular resolution of current CO observations. Therefore, our molecular observations are largely insensitive to the thin shocked gas layer; instead, they detect the environmental gas.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29f1</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] On the Orbital Evolution of Binaries with Polar Circumbinary Disks</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae3611</link><description>Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star-forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk will end up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae3611</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Untangling the connection between dopamine and ADHD</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00094-x</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 21 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00094-x"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00094-x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Dopamine signals have long been a target for ADHD treatments.

Using Ku-band data (12–18 GHz) from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and K-band data (17–25 GHz) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the quiescent spectrum can be decomposed into two components: one falling with frequency and one that remains flat. The flat component has a relatively steady flux density of 0.64 ± 0.14 mJy. The falling component varies in strength, but exhibits a spectral index of α = −0.88 ± 0.10. The falling component is thus consistent with nonthermal, optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation with a corresponding power-law index similar to flares from AU Mic. While a flat component may arise from thermal, optically thin free–free emission, the observed flux density and inferred mass-loss rate are both too large compared to previous stellar wind and X-ray emission theory and models, necessitating an alternative explanation. This flat component instead matches well with an optically thick gyroresonance component integrated over multiple source regions such that the composite spectra are reasonably flat. The persistence of these components across the rotational period suggests multiple source regions, which may help explain changes in flux density and persistent high-energy electrons.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2857</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Ultraviolet Radiation and Neutrinos: Two Messengers from CCSNe in the CSM Scenario</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2ada</link><description>Massive stars (&gt;8 M⊙) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the ultraviolet(UV)/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, fast blue optical transients may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN–CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT.

Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500–6500 K and metallicities from −0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-561, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and α-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass–metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae2a29</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Soot Planets Instead of Water Worlds</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae29a6</link><description>Some low-density exoplanets are thought to be water-rich worlds that formed beyond the snow line of their protoplanetary disk, possibly accreting coequal portions of rock and water. However, the compositions of bodies within the solar system and the stability of volatile-rich solids in accretionary disks suggest that a planet rich in water should also acquire as much as 40% refractory organic carbon (“soot”). This would reduce the water mass fraction well below 50%, making the composition of these planets similar to those of solar system comets. Here we show that soot-rich planets, with or without water, can account for the low average densities of exoplanets that were previously attributed to a binary combination of rock and water. Formed in locations beyond the soot and/or snow lines in disks, these planets are likely common in our galaxy and already observed by JWST. The surfaces and interiors of soot-rich planets will be influenced by the chemical and physical properties of carbonaceous phases, and the atmospheres of such planets may contain plentiful methane and other hydrocarbons, with implications for photochemical haze generation and habitability.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae29a6</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Author Correction: Anthropogenic influences on major tropical cyclone events</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10109-2</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 20 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10109-2"&gt;doi:10.1038/s41586-026-10109-2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Author Correction: Anthropogenic influences on major tropical cyclone events</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-026-10109-2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] COSI Short Gamma-Ray Burst Localization Using BGO Shield Data</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25fc</link><description>The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a NASA satellite mission under development designed to survey the entire sky at 0.2–5 MeV with a wide-field gamma-ray telescope. Its main instrument is a germanium detector array surrounded on the sides and bottom by bismuth germanium oxide scintillator active shields (the “Anticoincidence Subsystem” (ACS)) to reduce and monitor background and for detecting transients. COSI will have an onboard trigger algorithm to detect gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the ACS and send data to the ground for further analysis. In this paper, we present three localization methods that we evaluated for the localization of short GRBs (sGRBs) using the ACS light curves. The first method is the χ2 fit already used by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, which calculates the best fit between look-up tables and the GRB data. The second method is a maximum likelihood estimation fit implemented in bc-tools for the BurstCube mission that performs a fit between the instrument response function and the GRB data. The last method is based on deep learning techniques and consists of a neural network developed for the COSI mission and trained to perform a regression of the sGRB position, taking as input the count rates of each ACS panel. The localization errors obtained by analyzing simulated sGRBs with the three methods are consistent. Despite the theoretical similarity between the approaches, their consistency in results is noteworthy, as they differ substantially in their implementations and optimization processes. The bc-tools obtain the best localization accuracy.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25fc</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] How much protein do you actually need?</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00151-5</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 20 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00151-5"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00151-5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Super-high protein diets are promoted by influencers, but the science shows that there are limits to how much your body can use.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00151-5</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] POLAMI Multi-Wavelength Polarization Study of AGN Jets: A Millimeter-Optical Comparison</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10798</link><description>arXiv:2601.10798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-band polarimetry offers a powerful probe of AGN jets, accessing regions less affected by opacity and Faraday rotation than at longer radio wavelengths. As part of the POLAMI program, we have conducted 14 years of 1 mm and 3 mm polarization monitoring of a sample of gamma-ray-bright blazars with the IRAM 30-m telescope, complemented here with long-term optical polarimetric observations from multiple facilities. We aim to test whether current models of parsec-scale jet physics are consistent with observed multi-band polarization behavior. Using a Bayesian framework, we derive intrinsic mean flux densities and modulation indices for total flux and fractional polarization, and characterize EVPA variability using circular statistics. We then examine how these quantities reflecting variability properties across millimeter and optical bands relate to synchrotron peak frequency, jet orientation, and radio/gamma-ray luminosities. BL Lac objects exhibit, on average, higher fractional polarization and lower EVPA variability than FSRQs at all wavelengths. Fractional polarization increases with frequency, consistent with increasingly ordered magnetic fields at shorter wavelengths. BL Lacs also show more frequent alignment of EVPAs between optical and millimeter bands, whereas FSRQs display weaker coherence. EVPA variability correlates positively with radio and gamma-ray luminosities and negatively with synchrotron peak frequency, most strongly in the optical. We further find a positive correlation between EVPA spread and fractional polarization variability, suggesting a direct link between magnetic-field structure and polarization dynamics.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10798v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The impact of ram pressure on the radio spectral index and magnetic field of NGC 4522: A high-resolution VLA continuum study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10803</link><description>arXiv:2601.10803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-resolution Very Large Array (VLA) continuum observations at S-band ($3$ GHz, $560$ pc scale) and X-band ($10$ GHz, $200$ pc scale) of the ram-pressure-stripped Virgo galaxy NGC 4522, to investigate the characteristics of its radio continuum, spectral index, and magnetic field under the influence of the intracluster medium (ICM). The total radio continuum shows an asymmetry that extends northwest, mirroring the HI gas distribution, but showing distinct features in the extraplanar regions. The spectral index steepens systematically from $\alpha\sim-0.6$ in the main disk to $\alpha\sim-1.1$ in the outer disk. We find that the spectral index behavior of the outer disk is mainly due to an ICM shock that can re-accelerate electrons and a significant reduction of thermal emission. Intriguingly, extraplanar clouds exhibit exceptionally flat spectral indices ($\alpha\sim-0.2$ to $0$), resulting from a combination of significantly enhanced thermal emission and pronounced spectral aging of the non-thermal component. Although some of these regions correlate with H$\alpha$, others do not. We propose that the mixing between the ICM and interstellar medium (ISM) is an alternative mechanism that enhances thermal emission independently of star formation. Polarized continuum emissions are highly asymmetric, preferentially distributed along the ICM wind side, and the polarization fraction increases radially outward from the galactic midplane, indicating that the polarized emission is strongly influenced by the ICM wind. Our results show how and where the ICM substantially affects the ISM, and also demonstrate that high-frequency observations are crucial for analyzing the radio continuum of ram pressure stripping galaxies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10803v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] From a Network to a Networking: The Evolution of the Latin American Giant Observatory</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10893</link><description>arXiv:2601.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is a collaborative initiative that deploys a network of low-cost, autonomous Water Cherenkov Detectors across Latin America and Spain. Initially focused on detecting gamma-ray bursts at high-altitude sites, LAGO has evolved into a multidisciplinary forum for astroparticle physics, space weather studies, and environmental monitoring. Its detectors operate from sea level to over 4300 meters above sea level (m a.s.l.) in diverse geomagnetic and atmospheric conditions. The ARTI-MEIGA simulation framework is a key development that models the entire cosmic-ray interaction chain, enabling site-specific simulations to be integrated into FAIR-compliant workflows. LAGO also plays a significant role in regional education and training through partnerships with ERASMUS+ projects, positioning itself as a hub for research capacity building. New contributions emerging from the collaboration include volcano muography, neutron hydrometry for precision agriculture, and space weather monitoring in the South Atlantic Magnetic Anomaly. LAGO demonstrates how Cherenkov-based detection and open science can drive scientific discovery and practical innovation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10893v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] X-ray and radio observations of the AMXP MAXI J1957+032 covering the 2022-2025 outbursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10928</link><description>arXiv:2601.10928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented a comprehensive multi-epoch timing and multiwavelength analysis of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar MAXI J1957+032, covering two major outbursts in 2022 and 2025. By reanalyzing the 2022 outburst data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), we found the spin frequency and orbital parameters from the observations in 0.3-5 keV. For the 2025 outburst, we reported the detection of pulsations with the Einstein Probe (EP). Based on the $\sim$3-year baseline between these two outbursts, we measured a significant long-term spin-down rate of $\dot\nu = (-5.73 \pm 0.28) \times 10^{-14}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Assuming that the quiescent spin-down is driven by magnetic dipole radiation, we inferred a spin-down luminosity of $L \approx 1.1 \times 10^{36}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ and a surface dipolar magnetic field of $B \approx (7.3 - 10.4) \times 10^8$ G. Furthermore, we conducted a deep radio pulsation search with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) during the X-ray quiescent state in 2024, resulting in a non-detection with a 7$\sigma$ flux density upper limit of 12.3 $\mu$Jy. This corresponds to a radio efficiency upper limit of $\xi &lt; 2.8 \times 10^{-10}$, which is significantly lower than that of typical millisecond pulsars with a similar spin-down power. This profound radio pulsation faintness can be explained by two primary scenarios: either a geometric effect, wherein the pulsar's radio beam is directed away from our line of sight, or a physical suppression of the emission mechanism, potentially caused by a persistent low-level accretion flow during the X-ray quiescent state.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10928v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Radiative Cooling Effects on Plasmoid Formation in Black Hole Accretion Flows with Multiple Magnetic Loops</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10968</link><description>arXiv:2601.10968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. We investigate the physics of black hole accretion flows, particularly focusing on phenomena like magnetic reconnection and plasmoid formation, which are believed to be responsible for energetic events such as flares observed from astrophysical black holes.Aims. We aim to understand the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation within black hole accretion flows that are threaded by multi-loop magnetic field configurations.Methods. We conducted two- and three-dimensional two-temperature general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. By varying the magnetic loop sizes and the mass accretion rate, we explored how radiative cooling alters the accretion dynamics, disk structure, and the properties of reconnection-driven plasmoid chains.Results. Our results demonstrate that radiative cooling suppresses the transition to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state by reducing magnetic flux accumulation near the horizon. It significantly modifies the disk morphology by lowering the electron temperature and compressing the disk, which leads to increased density at the equatorial plane and decreased magnetization. Within the current sheets, radiative cooling triggers layer compression and the collapse of plasmoids, shortening their lifetime and reducing their size, while the frequency of plasmoid events increases. Moreover, we observe enhanced negative energy-at-infinity density in plasmoids near the ergosphere, with its peaks corresponding to plasmoid presence.Conclusions. Radiative cooling plays a critical role in shaping both macroscopic accretion flow properties and microscopic reconnection phenomena near black holes. This suggests that radiative cooling may modulate black hole energy extraction through reconnection-driven Penrose processes, highlighting its importance in models of astrophysical black holes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10968v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] How To Use Thermal Dust Continuum Emission To Measure The Physical Properties Of Dusty Astrophysical Objects</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10989</link><description>arXiv:2601.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust grains in the interstellar medium interact with photons across the electromagnetic spectrum. They are generally photon energy converters, absorbing short wavelength radiation and emitting long wavelength radiation. Sixty years ago in 1965, thermal emission from dust grains in the interstellar medium was discovered. This tutorial is a summary of the physics of thermal dust continuum emission and how to use observations of the intensity and flux density of dusty objects to calculate physical properties such as mass, column density, luminosity, dust temperature, and dust opacity spectral index. Equations are derived, when feasible, from first principles with all limits and assumptions explicitly stated. Properties of dust opacities appropriate for different astrophysical environments (e.g. diffuse ISM, dense cores, protoplanetary disks) are discussed and tabulated for the wavelengths of past, current, and future bolometer cameras. Corrections for observations at high redshift as well as the effects of telescope measurement limitations are derived. We also update the calculation of the mean molecular weight in different ISM environments and find that it is 1.404 per H atom, 2.809 per H2 molecule, and 2.351 per gas particle assuming protosolar metallicity and the latest values of the ISM gas phase abundances of metals.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10989v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] An 11-Year Catalog of Gamma-Ray Transients: A Comprehensive Search with Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor Data</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11032</link><description>arXiv:2601.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope has produced the largest database of all-sky observations in gamma rays with its continuous data with high time and energy resolutions. These data contain a wealth of unidentified transient events that did not trigger the detectors for various reasons. We conducted extensive searches to identify such untriggered transient events observed with GBM in 11 years (July 2010 - June 2021). In particular, we employed four different search modes with various energy ranges (mainly below 300 keV) and time resolutions (from 8 ms to 2 s), utilizing three statistical methods (signal-to-noise ratio, Poisson, and Bayesian statistics), each with different effectiveness in identifying specific classes of transients. Moreover, we developed algorithms for known-event flagging as well as unknown-event classification for our candidate events found in the searches. In this paper, we present our search methodologies, event flagging and classification algorithms and the resulting comprehensive event catalog. The catalog contains more than a million events in total, including known events such as gamma-ray bursts, soft-gamma repeater bursts, galactic X-ray source activities, terrestrial gamma flashes, and solar flares. For each candidate event, the catalog presents the event time, detection significance, event duration, hardness ratios, known-event flagging results, and classification probabilities. Our short-transient catalog significantly expands the currently-existing list of known events and complements the GBM trigger catalog. The event database with filtering capabilities is also publicly available at https://magnetars.sabanciuniv.edu/gbm, which allows users to retrieve event information based on their input queries along with the event lightcurves.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11032v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Investigating Pulsar Wind Nebula DA 495: Insights from LHAASO and Multi-Wavelength Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11071</link><description>arXiv:2601.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar wind nebula DA~495 (G65.7+1.2) has been extensively observed from radio to TeV $\gamma$-ray bands. We present LHAASO observations of DA~495, revealing an energy-dependent morphology, where an extended source with $r_{39}=0.19^{\circ}\pm0.02^{\circ}$ is detected by WCDA (0.4-15~TeV), and a point-like source with a 95\% upper limit of $r_{39}=0.11^{\circ}$ is observed by KM2A ($&gt;25~\mathrm{TeV}$). The spectrum of the source extends beyond 100~TeV with a break or cutoff at a few tens of TeV. Our X-ray data analysis, based on Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, shows that the X-ray emission of DA~495 extends well to $\sim 6^{\prime}$, significantly larger than the size previously reported. The broadband spectral energy distribution across radio, X-ray and TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is phenomenologically described by a one-zone leptonic model, yielding an average magnetic field of $\sim$ 5 $\mathrm{\mu G}$, while Fermi-LAT spectral analysis indicates a likely presence of a $\gamma$-ray pulsar within the system. A time-dependent model, in which particle transport is convection-dominated in the inner region (within $\sim100^{\prime\prime}$) and diffusion-dominated in the outer region, successfully reproduces the observed radial profiles of X-ray surface brightness and spectral index, and also accounts for the TeV $\gamma$-ray emission detected by LHAASO, suggesting that DA~495 represents an evolved PWN with ongoing particle escape that gives rise to a TeV halo component -- that is, a PWN+halo system.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11071v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Magnetic Topology and Loop Statistics in Observed Coronal Holes Using Potential Field Modeling</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11080</link><description>arXiv:2601.11080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models are widely used to study the solar corona and form the basis for solar wind forecasting, yet often fail to reproduce observed properties of coronal holes. We analyze 702 observed coronal holes between 2010 and 2019 and compute corresponding PFSS magnetic field extrapolations to examine their magnetic topology and loop statistics, comparing them with quiet Sun regions. Our goal is to determine how observed coronal holes are represented in a PFSS model and to identify sources of known discrepancies. We find that low-lying loops covering the weak, balanced background field in coronal holes are statistically smaller and narrower than in quiet Sun regions, with a median height strongly correlated to the coronal holes mean magnetic flux density (cc_Pearson = 0.81). This suggests that at low altitudes, the coronal hole magnetic topology is primarily governed by its flux density, unlike in quiet Sun regions. Coronal holes also contain loops extending much higher into the corona than typical quiet Sun loops, although it is unclear if these are truly closed or reflect source surface height limitations. Overall, differences in modeled magnetic structures of coronal holes and quiet Sun regions are evident, even when the PFSS model does not indicate any open fields. These results suggest that observed coronal holes correspond to distinct photospheric magnetic structures, and that discrepancies with PFSS models reflect modeling limitations rather than the absence of coronal holes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11080v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Role of Plasma Lensing in Fast Radio Bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11122</link><description>arXiv:2601.11122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magneto-ionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs), can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a $\sim 90^\circ$ PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few $\times10~\rm{rad~m^{-2}}$ between the multiple images. The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B-earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies-can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios. These results suggest that plasma lensing could account for multiple complex observational features of FRBs and may play a non-negligible role in modulating their observable properties.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11122v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Discovery of a gas-enshrouded broad-line AGN at z $\sim$ 7</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11125</link><description>arXiv:2601.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (Ly$\alpha$) absorption profile in star-forming galaxies serves as a powerful tracer of the extended, dense neutral hydrogen in their surroundings during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We report a unique galaxy, A2744-z7DLA, at $z\approx 6.87$ gravitationally lensed by the foreground galaxy cluster Abell 2744, which exhibits both moderate Ly$\alpha$ emission and damped Ly$\alpha$ absorption, suggesting the presence of a dense neutral hydrogen environment. Our analysis suggests that the UV continuum turnover near Ly$\alpha$ is more likely shaped by a damped Ly$\alpha$ system rather than nebular continuum from two photon process. We analyze the physical properties of A2744-z7DLA with spectroscopic and photometric data from the JWST and the HST. The galaxy shows a compact morphology ($r_e \sim 0.3\ {\rm kpc}$) and a broadened H$\alpha$ emission line, suggesting possible AGN activity. The broad component of H$\alpha$ has a FWHM of $2721 \pm 200\ {\rm km\ s^{-1}}$, corresponding to a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}=2.90^{+2.35}_{-1.28}\times 10^7 M_\odot$ and a black hole-to-stellar mass ratio of $\log (M_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm stellar}) = -1.58^{+0.45}_{-0.34}$. The Balmer decrement ($\rm H\alpha/H\beta$) yields a dust attenuation of $\rm A_V \approx 1.15 \pm 0.23$, indicating that this system is less dust-rich than some "little red dots". Furthermore, we perform SED fitting using both stellar and AGN models. The results show that the UV and optical wavelengths are dominated by star-forming regions, while the AGN component contributes primarily at longer wavelengths. This work provides new insights into the interplay between star formation, neutral gas, and potential AGN activity in galaxies during the EoR.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11125v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Molecular gas and star formation in central rings across nearby galaxies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11127</link><description>arXiv:2601.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby galaxies exhibit a variety of structures, including central rings, similar to the MW Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). These rings are common in barred galaxies and can be gas-rich and highly star-forming. We aim to study molecular gas content and star formation rate of central rings within nearby galaxies and link them to global galaxy properties (e.g. bar morphology). We utilize $1\,$'' resolution CO(2-1) PHANGS-ALMA observations, visually identify 20 central rings and determine their properties. For $14$ rings, SFR surface density maps are available. We derive ring geometry, integrated molecular gas masses, SFRs, depletion times, and compare them to host galaxy and bar properties. Molecular gas is a good tracer for central rings: Previous studies used ionized gas and dust tracers to identify central rings in galaxies of similar morphological types as this study. In comparison, we find similar fractions of galaxies hosting central rings and similar radii distributions. The gaseous central rings have typical radii of $400_{-150}^{+250}\,$pc, molecular gas masses of $\log(M_\text{mol}/M_\odot){\sim}8.1_{-0.23}^{+0.17}$, and SFRs of $0.21_{-0.16}^{+0.15}\,M_\odot/\text{yr}$, thus contributing $5.6_{-2.1}^{+4.5}\,\%$ and $13_{-5}^{+10}\,\%$ to their host galaxies' molecular gas mass and SFR. The MW CMZ sits at the lower end of the radius, molecular gas mass, and SFR distribution, but it has a similar molecular gas mass and SFR fraction, and depletion time. Longer bars contain more massive molecular central rings, but we find no correlation between bar strength and the ring's molecular gas content. Although absolute central ring properties likely depend on host galaxy properties, the similarities between the MW CMZ and PHANGS central rings in relative parameters suggest that the processes of gas inflow and star formation are similar for central rings across nearby galaxies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11127v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Unveiling Ionized Jet Morphologies: Sub-arcsecond VLA Observations of Compact Radio Sources</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11130</link><description>arXiv:2601.11130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present sub-arcsecond ($\theta\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$) resolution VLA 1.3 cm continuum and 22.2 GHz H$_2$O maser observations toward 15 compact radio continuum sources with rising spectral index and 8 string-like radio continuum structures in the Rosero et al. (2016, 2019) survey. Three different morphologies are observed: elongated or double-peak string-like structure (6 out of 23 cases), a collection of distinct continuum peaks (4 out of 23 cases), and single compact sources (13 out of 23 cases). The majority of H$_2$O maser spots detected are within a sky-projected distance of $\sim5,000$ au from the radio continuum peaks and tend to be well aligned and distributed in an elongated structure when more than three spots are observed. We generally recover less emission than Rosero et al. (2016, 2019), which together with the fact that more than half of the jet candidates in our survey appear mostly compact, suggest core/halo shock structures even on small scales. We also detected proper motion in 10 cases and measured an average projected velocity of approximately 120 km s$^{-1}$. Radio brightness variability is detected in at least two cases, possibly due to weak accretion bursts. This work, together with our previous molecular jet study, provides further evidence that support the main source of ionization in the studied sources is shocks, yet collimation is only observed in 4 cases. We conclude that the available data supports the thermal jet classification of 7 sources, and the ionized jet interpretation is further supported in 16 sources.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11130v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cluster number counts in dark energy model with energy and momentum coupling to dark matter</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11270</link><description>arXiv:2601.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influences on the cluster number counts from the coupling between dark energy and dark matter with momentum transfer are investigated. We find that the extrapolated linear density contrast computed from the spherical collapse model is suppressed when the strength of momentum transfer is increased. Using the Sheth-Tormen mass function, the cluster number counts are computed. The minimum mass limit in the mass integration for each redshift bin is determined by matching the predicted number counts from the $\Lambda$CDM model with the result from eROSITA surveys. We find that the number of clusters is maximal at a higher redshift bin, and the number of clusters in a maximum redshift bin is enhanced when the strength of momentum and energy transfers increases due to the reduction of extrapolated linear density contrast. Setting the parameters of the dark energy model with momentum coupling according to the observational constraints in \cite{bestfit}, the predicted number counts from the coupled dark energy is larger than the result from eROSITA surveys. The statistical analysis yields a $p$-value of 0.189 for the proposed model relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Consequently, there is no statistically significant evidence of an improved fit over the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework based on the eROSITA cluster number counts.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11270v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Star-forming compact groups: Tracing the early evolutionary stages of compact group environments</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11399</link><description>arXiv:2601.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of pre-processing -- a scenario in which galaxies quench their star formation within substructures before falling into clusters -- we investigate the impact of environment on the physical and morphological properties of galaxies in Compact Groups (CGs), focusing specifically on a sample of Star-Forming Compact Groups (SFCGs). Our aim is to characterize the physical and morphological properties of galaxies in SFCGs, analogues of the Blue Infalling Group, and to understand how the environment influences their evolution. We use photometric techniques to derive stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Morphological parameters are extracted from DECaLS images, obtaining parametric properties such as the S\'ersic index ($n$) and effective radius ($R_{\mathrm{e}}$) using GALFITM, as well as non-parametric indices -- including the Gini coefficient, $M_{20}$, and asymmetry -- from the same data. These indicators allow us to classify galaxies into E/S0/Sa, Sb/Sc/Ir, and merger types. All measurements are compared to a control sample of field galaxies to assess environmental effects. We find no significant differences in $n$ and $R_{\mathrm{e}}$ between SFCG and field galaxies, in contrast to results reported for other CG samples. However, SFCG galaxies exhibit higher specific star formation rates (sSFRs) than their field counterparts. Approximately $16\%$ of SFCG galaxies show merger features and elevated asymmetry. These mergers also present enhanced SFRs compared to both other SFCG types and the field population. We propose that SFCGs represent an earlier evolutionary phase of CGs, supported by their lower velocity dispersions and moderate crossing times, in addition to the observed SFR enhancement and the absence of pronounced morphological transformation. Galaxy mergers in this phase appear to enhance, rather than suppress, star formation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11399v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Rapid inference of gravitational-wave signals in the time domain using a heterodyned likelihood</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11239</link><description>arXiv:2601.11239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation of gravitational wave signals is computationally intensive and typically requires millions of likelihood evaluations to construct posterior probability distributions. This computational cost increases significantly in the time domain, which requires non-diagonal covariance matrices to compute the likelihood. Consequently, parameter estimation of long-duration gravitational wave signals, such as binary neutron star mergers, becomes computationally infeasible in time domain. In this work, we detail a framework for the heterodyned likelihood that enables rapid inference in the time domain. Our method is applicable to signals with arbitrary mode content, and leverages the smoothness of the ratio of complex-valued waveform modes, approximating the ratio as a linear function within appropriately chosen time bins. This allows downsampling of the waveform modes and a reformulation of the likelihood, such that it depends only on the bin edges. We demonstrate that this likelihood recovers posteriors that are indistinguishable from those obtained using the standard likelihood in the time domain. We also observe dramatic improvement in speed - for a 128 seconds-long gravitational wave signal, our method is at least $\sim 400$ times faster than the standard time-domain analysis, reducing the wall clock time to just a few hours. We also demonstrate the reliability and unbiasedness of the likelihood using percentile-percentile tests for binary black hole and binary neutron star injections. We use the Gohberg-Semencul representation of the inverse of Toeplitz covariance matrix to accelerate matrix-vector products, which has potential applications even in non heterodyned time-domain inference.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.11239v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Properties of Little Red Dot Galaxies in the ASTRID Simulation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20439</link><description>arXiv:2505.20439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.20439v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Critical Metallicity of Cool Supergiant Formation.

Abstract: This study investigates the physical origin of the critical metallicity required for the formation of cool supergiants, as revealed by stellar evolution models. Using grids of stellar models, we show that the terminal-age main-sequence (TAMS) radius, $R_{\rm TAMS}$, defines a threshold that determines whether a star of a given mass can evolve into the red supergiant (RSG) phase. Metallicity influences the supergiant outcome because it modifies $R_{\rm TAMS}$ through its effects on opacity and nuclear energy generation, as demonstrated by our stellar models and dimensional analysis based on homology relations. The value of $R_{\rm TAMS}$ sets the initial radius for post-main-sequence expansion and therefore controls the envelope radius reached at subsequent core-evolution stages. Higher-metallicity stars develop larger $R_{\rm TAMS}$ and rapidly expand into the stable RSG regime during core helium burning. In contrast, lower-metallicity stars have smaller $R_{\rm TAMS}$ and advance to more evolved core helium or carbon-burning stages while retaining compact envelopes, thereby preventing expansion into the RSG regime during core helium burning. Our results explain the origin of the critical metallicity and offer insight into the evolution of metal-poor massive stars in the early universe.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.01753v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A JWST Transit of a Jupiter Analog I: Constraints on the Oblateness of Kepler-167e</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02067</link><description>arXiv:2511.02067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In October 2024 JWST observed a transit of Kepler-167e, a Jupiter-analog planet on a 1000+ day orbit. These observations, recorded over a long baseline of nearly 60 hours, were designed to search for signatures of planetary oblateness and/or exomoons comparable to Ganymede. In this first in a series of studies analyzing these data we report on constraints on Kepler-167e's oblateness. We explored a large grid of data reduction pipelines and modeling choices, including a new entirely independent reduction pipeline ("katahdin") and two new treatments for limb darkening. We find that under a Bayesian model comparison framework the data are fit equally well by both spherical and oblate planet models, and that our ability to constrain the oblateness is negatively impacted by the influence of exposure-long trends. Using the most conservative of our posteriors, we place a 95% upper bound on the projected oblateness of $f&lt;0.097$, which corresponds to a rotation period of $P\geq7.11$ hours if the planet's spin axis is aligned with the sky plane. We note, however, that the final bound depends on the choice of reduction pipeline and systematics model, and that our suite of end-to-end analyses produced bounds as low as $f&lt;0.065$ at 95%. We conclude that leveraging JWST to make tighter constraints on planetary oblateness will require further investigation into mitigating exposure-long trends and correlated noise.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.02067v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Brightest GRB flare observed in GRB 221009A: bridge the last gap between flare and prompt emission in GRB</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07688</link><description>arXiv:2601.07688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in soft X-ray, optical and radio bands, but rarely in gamma-ray band. Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07688v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The influence of magnetic fields in Cloud-Cloud Collisions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09794</link><description>arXiv:2601.09794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-cloud collisions are expected to trigger star formation by compressing gas into dense, gravitationally unstable regions. However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \,$M$_{\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09794v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Plasma</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16630</link><description>arXiv:2512.16630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.16630v4</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Explosions in the Empty: A Survey of Transients in Local Void Galaxies</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae21e3</link><description>We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events—including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs)—in void and nonvoid galaxies within the local Universe (0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.05). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multiwavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse SNe are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia SNe are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae21e3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Toward Understanding the Origin of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts Driven by Magnetars</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae24e3</link><description>In this paper, we analyze a sample of Swift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with extended emissions in γ-rays and/or X-ray plateaus that may be driven by magnetars. Multiwavelength data and multistandards have been adopted to investigate the issue jointly. First, we find that GRBs with both extended emission and X-ray plateau satisfy a three-parameter relation between the luminosity and the end time of X-ray plateaus and the γ-ray isotropic energy as , which is consistent with that of normal GRBs. Second, we distinguish these GRBs in the plane of magnetic field versus period of neutron star and find that almost all GRBs, except GRB 211024B, have reasonable periods, and the majority of them could be powered by magnetars. Third, we standardize the X-ray afterglows with distinct characteristics and find that the standard X-ray light curves with/without plateaus are significantly different. The standardized X-ray plateaus are similar to the mean temporal profile of magnetars. Fourth, it is verified with a K-S test that all types of GRBs except short ones have similar distributions of redshift and isotropic energy in the observer/rest frame. GRBs with internal plateaus are significantly different from those of normal long GRBs and GRBs with external plateaus and/or extended emissions. Interestingly, the isotropic energy distributions of GRBs with internal and external plateaus are identical with those of short and long GRBs, respectively. Overall, our study can bring solid evidence that the fascinating magnetars could have multiformation channels to account for not only short but also long GRBs with either internal or external X-ray plateaus as well.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae24e3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The NANOGrav 15 yr Dataset: Search for Gravitational Scattering of Pulsars by Free-floating Objects in Interstellar Space</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae279d</link><description>Free-floating objects (FFOs) in interstellar space—rogue planets, brown dwarfs, and large asteroids that are not gravitationally bound to any star—are expected to be ubiquitous throughout the Milky Way. Recent microlensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not bound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects, namely 1I/’Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing through our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories. In this work, we search for FFOs on hyperbolic orbits that pass near millisecond pulsars (MSPs), where their gravitational influence can induce detectable perturbations in pulse arrival times. Using the NANOGrav 15 yr narrow band dataset, which contains high-precision timing data for 68 MSPs, we conduct a search for such hyperbolic scattering events between FFOs and pulsars. Although no statistically significant events were detected, this nondetection enables us to place upper limits (ULs) on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our local region of the Galaxy. For example, the UL on the number density for Jupiter-mass FFOs (∼10−2.5–10−3.5M⊙) obtained from different pulsars ranges from 5.25 × 106 pc−3 to 5.37 × 109 pc−3, while the UL calculated by combining results from all the pulsars is 6.03 × 105 pc−3. These results represent the first constraints on FFO population derived from pulsar timing data.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae279d</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Magnetic White Dwarf–M Dwarf Binaries in Pre-mCV Phase as Special Population of Long-period Radio Transients</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2864</link><description>Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704–37, with periods of 2–3 hr have been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD)–M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD–MD binaries in the pre-magnetic cataclysmic variables (pre-mCV) phase. The asynchronism between the WD’s rotation and the binary’s orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere-interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under an asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-mCV phase characterized by an extremely low-accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for an LCDM mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of 10−3−10−1 is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary’s magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD–MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD–MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following fP(P)dP ∝ P(1.67−2.33)dP and a luminosity function described by fL(L)dL ∝ L−(1.80−2.67)dL, which can be tested by the future large sample.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2864</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] New Hard X-Ray and Multiwavelength Study of the PeVatron Candidate PWN G0.9+0.1 in the Galactic Center Region</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09788</link><description>arXiv:2601.09788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new X-ray study and multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling of the young pulsar wind nebula (PWN) powered by the energetic pulsar PSR J1747-2809, inside the composite supernova remnant (SNR) G0.9+0.1, located in the Galactic Center region. The source is detected by NuSTAR up to 30 keV with evidence for the synchrotron burnoff effect in the changing spatial morphology with increasing energy. The broadband 2-30 keV spectrum of PWN G0.9+0.1 is modeled by a single power law with photon index $\Gamma=2.11\pm0.07$. We combined the new X-ray data with the multiwavelength observations in radio, GeV, and TeV gamma rays and modeled the SED, applying a one-zone and a multi-zone leptonic model. The comparison of the models is successful, as we obtained physically compatible results in the two cases. Through the one-zone model, we constrain the age of the system to $\sim2.2$ kyr, as well as reproduce the observed PWN and SNR radio sizes. In both the one-zone and multi-zone leptonic models, the electron injection spectrum is well-described by a single power law with spectral index $p \sim 2.6$ and a maximum electron energy of $\sim2$ PeV, suggesting the source could be a leptonic PeVatron candidate. We estimate the average magnetic field to be $B_{\rm PWN} \sim 20\ \mu$G. We also report the serendipitous NuSTAR detection of renewed X-ray activity from the very faint X-ray transient XMMU J174716.1-281048 and characterize its spectrum.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09788v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The influence of magnetic fields in Cloud-Cloud Collisions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09794</link><description>arXiv:2601.09794v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Luminous infrared galaxies are key sites of obscured stellar mass assembly at z &gt; 0.5. Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (&gt;= 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR ~= 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to ~1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z &lt; 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09810v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Are Recently Quenched Ellipticals Truly Isolated Centrals?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09846</link><description>arXiv:2601.09846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Quenched Ellipticals (RQEs) provide a valuable test case for disentangling intrinsic and environmental quenching, particularly because they are commonly classified as isolated central galaxies in low-mass halos. However, central/satellite assignments and isolation labels can vary across group catalogs, and such misclassifications can strongly bias physical interpretations. We present a uniform, physically motivated reassessment of the environments of 155 RQEs previously identified as centrals in an SDSS-based group catalog. We construct value-added neighbor catalogs via KD-tree searches and apply consistent thresholds in projected separation and line-of-sight velocity to (i) verify centrality, (ii) quantify isolation using a mass-ratio-based companion criterion, and (iii) identify potential pseudo-centrals via proximity to massive clusters. We find that 132/155 (85.2\%) RQEs remain true centrals, while 23/155 (14.8\%) are better interpreted as misidentified centrals with a more massive neighbor within $R_{\rm proj}\leq0.8$~Mpc and $\Delta V\leq250$~km~s$^{-1}$. Among the true centrals, 110/132 (83.3\%) satisfy our isolation criterion, and only one system meets our pseudo-central definition, indicating that direct cluster-scale preprocessing is rare for RQE centrals. Using projected number density and surface stellar mass density, we show that misidentified and non-isolated systems occupy systematically denser regimes than isolated true centrals. These results imply that while most RQEs ($\sim$71\%) are consistent with predominantly internal quenching in genuinely isolated centrals, a non-negligible minority ($\sim$29\%) likely experienced environmentally influenced pathways at group scales.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09846v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Dynamics of Apsidal Motion in Non-Synchronous Binary Pulsars Coupled Orbit and Spin Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09868</link><description>arXiv:2601.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apsidal motion of a non-synchronous binary pulsar serves as a valuable probe of relativistic gravity, stellar stricture, and dynamical evolution of close binary systems, In this study, we investigate the combined influence of general relativity, stellar oblateness and tidal interaction on the apsidal motion of three binary pulsars: 1913+16, J0737-3039A/B, and J0621+1002. Zahn's tidal equations \cite{1977A&amp;amp;A....57..383Z, 1989A&amp;amp;A...220..112Z} were employed for numerical integrations to describe tidal effects and their role in orbital and spin evolution. We estimated the timescales for tidal synchronization and orbital circularization for each system. The results indicate that tidal effects play only a minor role in orbital decay compared with energy loss due to gravitational wave emission. This is evident in the compact system PSR 1913+16, where the orbital period decreases by approximately 76.5 $\mu$s/yr as a result of gravitational radiation. The double pulsar J0737-3039A/B exhibits faster orbital evolution, with synchronization occurring in about 8.4$\times10{^3}$ years, whereas the wider system J0621+1002 shows negligible orbital change over timescales exceeding 10$^{10}$ years. The simulations demonstrate clear trends of decreasing semi-major axis and eccentricity, accompanied by an increase in spin rate among the binary pulsars studied. The derived apsidal motion constants [$k\simeq0.1$] are consistent with theoretical expected values, and the corresponding tidal friction times (between a few hours to several days) agree well with theoretical predication. These results emphasize the dominant role of relativistic effects in neutron star binaries and highlight the importance of including gravitational-wave terms long-term orbital evolution</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09868v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cycle dependence of helioseismic oscillations above the acoustic cut-off frequency</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10283</link><description>arXiv:2601.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helioseismic and recent asteroseismic observations reveal fine structure in the power spectrum with alternating peaks and troughs above the acoustic cut-off frequency. This structure is interpreted as the interference patterns of high-frequency acoustic waves excited in the solar interior and propagating into the atmosphere, known as pseudomodes. Pseudomodes exhibit clear solar-cycle variability, with frequency shifts that occur predominantly in anti-phase with the activity cycle, although the underlying mechanism remains uncertain. This work investigates how the subsurface excitation source location and the photospheric acoustic cut-off frequency influence the formation, frequency distribution, and solar-cycle variability of pseudomodes. We employ an analytical Klein-Gordon subsurface cavity model, which is shown to act as an effective Fabry-P\'erot interferometer for high-frequency waves that experience constructive and destructive interference between the source location and the lower turning point. We derive an effective dispersion relation isolating the effects of the source location and photospheric cut-off on the pseudomode frequency. The model reproduces the observed peak-trough pseudomode spectrum for reasonable parameter values constrained by Bayesian MCMC best-fitting to GONG observations. We also find that solar-cycle-associated 11-year modulations of the source location result in anti-phase pseudomode frequency shifts, whereas similar cyclic variations in the cut-off frequency produce harmonic-dependent behaviour, yielding both in-phase and anti-phase shifts. As the acoustic cut-off and mode excitation relate to stratification and flows in the solar interior, the results highlight pseudomodes as a powerful diagnostic tool for changes in subsurface solar and stellar structure through the solar cycle.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10283v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] How disc initial conditions sculpt the atmospheric composition of giant planets</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10285</link><description>arXiv:2601.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past studies have revealed the dependency of the disc parameters (mass, radius, viscosity, grain fragmentation velocity, dust-to-gas ratio) on the formation of giant planets, where more massive discs seem beneficial for giant planet formation. It is unclear how the different disc properties influence the composition of forming giant planets. The idea that the atmospheric abundances can trace directly the formation location of planets is put into question, due to the chemical evolution of the disc, caused by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. This complicates the idea of a relation between atmospheric abundances and planet formation locations. We use planet formation simulations that include the effects of pebble drift and evaporation and investigate how the different disc parameters influence the atmospheric composition of giant planets. We focus on the atmospheric C/O, C/H, O/H and S/H ratios allowing us to probe tracers for volatiles and refractories and thus different accretion pathways of giant planets. We find that most of the disc parameters have only a limited influence on the atmospheric abundances of gas giants, except for the dust-to-gas ratio, where a larger value results in higher atmospheric abundances. However the atmospheric abundances are determined by the planetary formation location, even in the pebble drift and evaporation scenario. Our study suggests that volatile-rich giant exoplanets predominantly form in the inner disc regions, where they can accrete large fractions of vapour-enhanced gas. Our study shows that simulations that try to trace the origin of giant planets via their atmospheric abundances do not have to probe all disc parameters, as long as the disc parameters allow the formation of giant planets. Our study thus suggests that the diversity of observed planetary compositions is a direct consequence of their formation location and migration history.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10285v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Multimessenger Prospects for Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts: Joint Neutrino and X-Ray Observations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10317</link><description>arXiv:2601.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low--luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LLGRBs) are promising candidates for high-energy neutrinos, yet no coincident neutrino events have been detected so far. Recent advances in X-ray time-domain astronomy, together with the development of next-generation neutrino telescopes, open new opportunities for joint X-ray and neutrino observations of these transients. We calculate the jet dynamical evolution and the associated neutrino production for both non-magnetized and magnetized outflows. For individual events, joint X-ray and neutrino detection is generally limited to nearby LLGRBs or sources with high luminosities. Thus, we consider a next-generation neutrino telescope with an effective area enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ relative to IceCube. In the non-magnetized scenario, joint detection of individual events is enabled for sources with typical isotropic luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to luminosity distances of $D_L\sim1.6\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $1$ per year. In contrast, for the magnetized scenario at the same luminosity, the accessible distance is significantly reduced, with joint observations confined to sources within $D_L\sim6.5\times10^{1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and an expected detection rate of order $0.5$ per year. For stacked samples of $\sim100$ magnetized LLGRBs, stacking substantially enlarges the accessible distance range, enabling joint observations for sources with representative luminosities of $L_{\mathrm{iso}}\sim1\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ out to $D_L\lesssim7.0\times10^{2}\,\mathrm{Mpc}$ and corresponding to an expected detection rate of order $2$ per year. These results demonstrate that joint X-ray and next-generation neutrino observations enable a practical multimessenger probe of LLGRBs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10317v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Testing the correlation between bending angle and polarization properties of bent radio galaxies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10361</link><description>arXiv:2601.10361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bending of radio galaxies in galaxy clusters is expected to be caused by interactions with the local environment. The physical processes responsible for jet bending, and their influence on the polarization properties of radio galaxies, remain poorly understood, leading to the question of whether jet properties in bent radio galaxies differ from those in linear radio galaxies. Using a sample of 24 polarized bent radio galaxies, observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1--2 GHz, we test for correlation of bending angle with polarization parameters measuring Faraday rotation, intrinsic fractional polarization, and Faraday rotation dispersion, used here as a measure of turbulence along the line of sight. We find no statistically significant correlations. At the spatial resolution of our dataset (3--46 kpc, median 18.4 kpc), our results indicate that we are primarily probing larger-scale intracluster medium effects not related to bending angle. The absence of a statistically significant correlation suggests that bent radio galaxies are reliable probes of intracluster magnetic fields, because their intrinsic properties do not appear to introduce systematic biases into measured polarization parameters. We do detect a preference for source magnetic field vectors to align with the direction of jet bending. Finally, we estimate that the POSSUM and SKA surveys will contain $\gtrsim$300 and $\gtrsim$1000 polarized radio galaxies, respectively, providing large future samples with a range of bending angles and similar redshift distribution and number of beams per source as in our sample, enabling our results to be tested with greater statistical power.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10361v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Long Period Transients (LPTs): a comprehensive review</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10393</link><description>arXiv:2601.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Period Transients (LPTs) are a recently identified class of sources characterized by periodic radio bursts lasting seconds to minutes, with flux densities that might reach several tens of Jy. These radio bursts repeat with periodicity from minutes to hours, and they exhibit strong polarization and transient activity periods. To date, about 12 such sources have been identified, which might encompass the same or different physical scenarios. Proposed explanations include binary systems with a white dwarf and a low-mass star companion, slow-spinning magnetars, highly magnetized isolated white dwarfs, and other exotic objects. In a few cases the optical counterpart indeed points toward a white dwarf with a low-mass companion, while in other cases, transient X-ray emission was detected, very common in magnetars. However, despite being able to reproduce partially some of the characteristics of LPTs, all the proposed scenarios find difficulty in explaining the exact physical origin of their bright, highly polarized and periodic radio emission. We review here the state-of-the-art in the observations and interpretation of this puzzling class of radio transients.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10393v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] HII regions in NGC 628: the view of two catalogs</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10642</link><description>arXiv:2601.10642v1 Announce Type: new

  The results of the study showed that the regions from the Groves catalog demonstrate higher line widths compared to the Kongiu catalog.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of massless particles -- specifically photons -- in the spacetime of a charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) surrounded by a cloud of strings (CoS) within the framework of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We analyze the effective potential that governs photon trajectories, explore the properties and location of the photon sphere (PS), and examine the effective radial force acting on photons. The resulting BH shadow is also studied, highlighting the roles of both the CoS parameter $\alpha$ and the KR field parameter $\ell$ in shaping its geometry. We constrain these parameters using observational data from M87* and Sgr A* obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). Furthermore, we extend our investigation to the motion of neutral test particles in the same gravitational background. By examining the impact of the CoS and KR field, we show how these additional fields modify the dynamics relative to standard charged BH scenarios. Finally, we study the fundamental frequencies associated with quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) of test particles, demonstrating how these frequencies are affected by the presence of the CoS and KR field. Our results reveal the rich structure of AdS-BH spacetimes influenced by string clouds and antisymmetric tensor fields, with potential observational consequences in gravitational wave and BH imaging astronomy.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10303v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Charged Simpson-Visser AdS Black Holes: Geodesic Structure and Thermodynamic Properties</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10469</link><description>arXiv:2601.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we apply the Simpson-Visser (SV) regularization scheme to Anti-de Sitter (AdS) charged black holes and investigate the resulting spacetime geometry in detail, with emphasis on both geodesic structure and thermodynamic behavior. In particular, we analyze the motion of massless particle, focusing on key features such as the photon sphere, black hole shadow, photon trajectory and the dynamics of charged particles, including the characteristics of the circular and type of orbits. Furthermore, we compare the theoretical predictions of the charged SV-AdS black hole with recent observations reported by the Event Horizon telescope (EHT) for M87* and Sgr~A*. Beyond the geodesic analysis, we explore the thermodynamics of the regularized charged SV-AdS black hole by deriving essential quantities such as the Hawking temperature, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat capacity. Through a systematic examination of these thermodynamic variables, we demonstrate how the regularization parameter inherent in the SV regularization influences particle dynamics, stability conditions, and the overall thermal properties of the modified black hole solution. This comprehensive study highlights the interplay between regularization effects and the physical observables associated with charged AdS black holes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10469v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] From Weibel seeds to collisionless dynamos beyond pair-plasmas</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10472</link><description>arXiv:2601.10472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the spatiotemporal scales of magnetic seed field generation and subsequent dynamo amplification in the weakly collisional intracluster medium presents an extreme numerical challenge. We perform collisionless turbulence simulations with initially unmagnetized electrons that capture both magnetic seed generation via the electron Weibel instability and the ensuing dynamo amplification. Going beyond existing pair-plasma studies, we use an ion-to-electron mass ratio of 100 for which we find electron and ion dynamics are sufficiently decoupled. These simulations are enabled by the 10-moment collisionless fluid solver of Gkeyll, which evolves the full pressure tensor for all species. The electron heat-flux closure regulates pressure isotropization and effectively sets the magnetic Reynolds number. We investigate how the strength of of the closure influences the transition between a regime reminiscent of previous kinetic pair-plasma simulations and a more MHD-like dynamo regime.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10472v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Numerical simulations of oscillating and differentially rotating neutron stars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10550</link><description>arXiv:2601.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remnants of binary neutron star mergers are expected to be massive, rapidly rotating stars whose oscillations produce gravitational waves in the kilohertz band. The degree of differential rotation and the rotation profiles strongly influence their structure, stability and oscillation spectrum, and must therefore be taken into account when modeling their dynamics. We extend the pseudospectral code ROXAS (Relativistic Oscillations of non-aXisymmetric neutron stArS) to enable the dynamical evolution of oscillating, differentially rotating neutron stars. Using the updated code, we aim to study the star's oscillation frequencies. We extend the previous formalism, based on primitive variables and the conformal flatness approximation, to differential rotation. Within this framework, we run a series of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric simulations of perturbed, differentially rotating neutron stars with different rotation rates, and extract their oscillation frequencies. Axisymmetric modes, as well as those under the Cowling approximation, show excellent agreement with published results. We show that the secondary fundamental mode in the Cowling approximation is an artifact that does not appear in dynamical spacetimes. In addition, we provide, for the first time, frequency values for non-axisymmetric modes in differentially rotating configurations evolved in conformal flatness. This extension broadens the range of physical scenarios that can be studied with ROXAS, and represents a step toward more realistic modeling of post-merger remnants and their gravitational-wave emission.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.10550v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Angular-momentum pairs in spherical systems: applications to the Galactic centre</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10551</link><description>arXiv:2507.10551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems objects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli, represented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the persistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This process, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes which change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between objects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show that nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in angular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an external massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to the Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the angular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the perturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance. Angular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will remain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any external influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive perturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts, including galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre, globular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a central super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young, massive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to constrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the nearby gaseous torus.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.10551v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Topology of the Superconducting Heart of Neutron Stars: Effects of Microphysics and Gravitational-Wave Signatures</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18363</link><description>arXiv:2508.18363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general-relativistic study of the distribution of proton superconductivity in strongly magnetized neutron stars (NSs), using the XNS code to solve the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations. We investigate equilibrium configurations with both toroidal and poloidal magnetic field geometries and incorporate complex many-body effects through microscopically derived proton pairing gaps. The models employ equations of state (EoS) obtained from microscopic many-body theory - including realistic two- and three-body nuclear interactions - as well as from relativistic mean-field approaches. We compare superconducting topologies across our collection of EoS and explore the influences of magnetic field geometry in stellar models parameterized by central density. Our models confirm the absence of $S$-wave superconductivity in the inner core and, importantly, reveal that non-superconducting regions exhibit complex three-dimensional geometries: doughnut-shaped for toroidal fields and prolate-shaped for poloidal fields -- spatial structures that are inherently absent in one-dimensional analyses. We also compute magnetic deformations and ellipticities for several millisecond pulsars (MSPs), estimating their continuous gravitational wave strain. While these MSPs remain undetectable by current detectors, next-generation instruments such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer may detect their signals, opening an observational window into internal superconductivity and internal magnetic field of NSs, as well as the fundamental microphysics of dense matter.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.18363v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Next-Generation Improvements in Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary and Structural Models</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08681</link><description>arXiv:2510.08681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many evolutionary models of giant exoplanets still rely on simplifying assumptions that are no longer adequate given detailed constraints from Jupiter, Saturn, and modern exoplanet observations. Here, we identify the key physical improvements required for next-generation planetary evolution models using our code, \texttt{APPLE}, which enables systematic emulation and extension of legacy studies. We quantify the effects of updated equations of state, helium rain, fuzzy cores, non-adiabatic and compositionally inhomogeneous envelopes, and improved atmospheric boundary conditions by first isolating the impact of each physical ingredient and then constructing combined baseline models for planets with masses between 0.3 and 4~$M_{\rm Jup}$ to assess their collective influence on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences ($\sim 5$ to 10\%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by $\sim$ 5 to 20\%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.08681v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09054</link><description>arXiv:2601.09054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012. The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \(1.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at 71 nHz and \(2.3 \times 10^{-13}\) at 1 \textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \(6.2 \times 10^{-15}\) and \(8.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at the same frequencies, respectively.

Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and their dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multiwavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that, in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae21c1</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] CLASSY.

However, because of the opacity of the intergalactic medium, it is often not possible to make direct measurements of the ionizing photon escape fraction ( ) of high-redshift (z ≳ 4) galaxies. To explore the agreement and systematics of common indirect approaches, we applied six empirically calibrated diagnostics to predict for the 45 nearby star-forming galaxies from the COS Legacy Spectroscopic SurveY. These methods—based on ultraviolet (UV) absorption lines, the UV continuum slope, Lyα kinematics, a multivariate model, radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, and nebular emission-line ratios—enable us to explore systematic differences between predictions and assess how galactic properties influence inferred LyC escape. Despite significant variations in method predictions, there is broad consistency in the resulting weak and strong LyC leaker classifications, with approximately half exhibiting predicted escape fractions &gt;1%. We find evidence for two different pathways of LyC escape in nearby star-forming galaxies: (1) an early escape model driven by very young stellar populations, and (2) a delayed escape model that is consistent with supernova-driven outflows and time-dependent interstellar medium clearing. The early escape model is favored among galaxies with a single, intense burst of recent star formation. In contrast, the delayed escape model is common among galaxies with more extended starburst histories. To interpret ionizing photon escape during the EoR, it will be necessary to recognize and understand this diversity in LyC escape mechanisms.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae22d9</guid></item><item><title>[Nature] Climate trends influence transatlantic flight times</title><link>https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00129-3</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Nature, Published online: 16 January 2026; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00129-3"&gt;doi:10.1038/d41586-026-00129-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Better understanding of multi-year global weather cycles could help airlines to reduce fuel consumption and cost.</description><author>Nature</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-026-00129-3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Time Evolution of Optical Darkness in Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglow: The Case of GRB 240825A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae1e7d</link><description>Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness (βOX) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical spectral energy distributions of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The βOX exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at ∼1000 s post-trigger. However, at 11 hr post-trigger, βOX does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae1e7d</guid></item><item><title>[The Astronomica] The Identification of New Herbig Ae/Be Stars from LAMOST DR7</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae2c4f</link><description>Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) are critical tracers of intermediate- and high-mass star formation, yet their census remains incomplete compared to low-mass young stellar objects like T-Tauri stars. To expand the known population, we systematically searched for HAeBes in LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra. Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine classification, identifying ∼240,000 spectra with potential Hα emission. After removing contaminants (nonstellar objects, extragalactic sources, cataclysmic variables, and Algol systems) and restricting to B/A-type stars, we obtained 1835 candidates through 2MASS/WISE visual inspection. Spectral energy distribution analysis confirmed 143 sources with infrared excess (J band or longer wavelengths), including 92 known HAeBes. From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the (K − W1)0 versus (W2 − W3)0 diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy (K − W1)0 ≤ 0.5 and (W2 − W3)0 ≤ 1.1, while other regions trace transition disks ((K − W1)0 &lt; 0.5 and (W2 − W3)0 &gt; 1.1), globally depleted disks ((K − W1)0 &gt; 0.5 and (W2 − W3)0 &lt; 1.1), and Class I/Flat/II HAeBes ((K − W1)0 &gt; 0.5 and (W2 − W3)0 &gt; 1.1). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0, 0) with semimajor axes of a = 1.5, a = 3.0, and a = 4.0, and a semimajor to semiminor axis ratio of 1.6:1.</description><author>The Astronomical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae2c4f</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Expanding the High-z Supernova Frontier: "Wide-Area" JWST Discoveries from the First Two Years of COSMOS-Web</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08931</link><description>arXiv:2601.08931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z &gt; 2) remains largely unexplored, lying beyond the rest-frame optical spectroscopic reach of most current observatories. Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of ~133 arcmin^2 (~0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z &lt; 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z &gt; 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z &gt; 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08931v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Spinning compact object and chaos in galactic centers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08937</link><description>arXiv:2601.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic centres are highly dynamic regions dominated by a supermassive black hole (BH) surrounded by nuclear star clusters (NSC), molecular gas, and asymmetric matter distributions such as disks or halos. The combined gravitational effects of these components, along with relativistic corrections from the BH's spin, generate strongly nonlinear dynamics and frequent chaotic orbital behaviour. To model this environment, we employ a multipolar expansion potential in which the central compact object is represented by the Artemova-Bjornsson-Novikov pseudo-Newtonian potential, effectively capturing spin-dependent features of a Kerr-like BH. The surrounding halo is treated as an axisymmetric, shell-like mass distribution expanded up to third order in multipolar terms to account for realistic asymmetry. Previous studies have mainly explored the influence of multipolar moments and BH spin using Poincare sections, SALI, and related chaos indicators. In this work, we extend these analyses by incorporating stability analysis and basins of convergence to achieve a more complete understanding of the system's dynamics. Stability analysis around equilibrium points provides insight into local behavior, while basins of convergence highlight sensitivity to initial conditions and expose fractal basin boundaries. Our results show that the BH spin significantly reshapes phase space: depending on its magnitude and orientation, it can either amplify chaotic scattering caused by halo asymmetry or stabilize specific orbital families. These findings enhance our understanding of how relativistic spin effects and multipolar mass distributions jointly govern the dynamical architecture of galactic centers.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08937v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09054</link><description>arXiv:2601.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012. The observations, conducted at three different radio frequencies with the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Telescope (NRT) and Parkes Telescope (PKS) and five frequencies with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), enabled precise corrections for dispersion measure effects and scattering variations. After these corrections, the timing residuals showed an unmodeled periodic noise component with an amplitude of 340 ns. Our analysis yields upper limits on the GW strain from individual sources, constraining it to be below \(1.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at 71 nHz and \(2.3 \times 10^{-13}\) at 1 \textmu Hz for average sky locations, while for optimal source locations the limits improve to \(6.2 \times 10^{-15}\) and \(8.9 \times 10^{-14}\) at the same frequencies, respectively.

Abstract: Ultracompact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) are thought to be remnants of stripped galactic nuclei, among which a handful are known to host a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). As in stripped nuclear star clusters, the SMBHs in UCDs may be fed by stellar winds from old stellar populations, in the absence of substantial gas reservoirs and galactic inflows. In this work, we investigate such a wind-fed accretion scenario for M60-UCD1, which harbors a confirmed $2\times10^7~M_\odot$ SMBH and exhibits X-ray emission suggestive of SMBH accretion signature. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations, we simulate the SMBH accreting stellar winds from approximately 1500 asymptotic giant branch stars, and explore the role of ram pressure from the ambient interstellar or intracluster medium. After 5 Myr, the majority of the stellar winds form a cold gas disk ($\sim1000~M_\odot$) within $\sim10~\rm pc$ as well as the SMBH's gravitational sphere of influence. Within the inner $10^4~r_{\rm g}$, this disk transitions into a hot ($\sim10^7-10^9~\rm K$), geometrically thick corona that dominates the X-ray emission. The SMBH achieves an accretion rate of $\sim10^{-5}~M_\odot~\rm yr^{-1}$, yielding an X-ray luminosity of $\sim7\times10^{37}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$, well consistent with observations. Including ram pressure stripping reduces both the accretion rate and luminosity by about a factor of two. Our results suggest that the X-ray counterpart of M60-UCD1 originates from a weakly accreting SMBH fed by stellar winds, with broader insights into the feeding mechanisms of central massive black holes and the origins of X-ray sources in other UCDs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09199v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Quasar Feedback Survey: Revealing the importance of sensitive radio imaging for AGN identification deeper into the radio-quiet regime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09218</link><description>arXiv:2601.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new sub-arcsecond ($\sim$0.3-1 arcsec; $\sim$1--3\,kpc) VLA imaging at 1.4\,GHz and 6\,GHz of 29 optically-selected, [O~{\sc iii}] luminous ($L_{\rm [O III]}$ &gt; 10$^{42.1}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$), $z&lt;0.2$ quasars drawn from the expanded Quasar Feedback Survey (QFeedS; with $L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz} = 10^{22.6}$--10$^{26.3}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$). These 29 new objects occupy the low end of the radio-power distribution ($L_\mathrm{1.4\,GHz}$=$10^{22.63}$--10$^{23.45}$\,W\,Hz$^{-1}$) in the QFeedS sample and are nominally `radio quiet'. Despite this, we find widespread evidence of AGN-driven synchrotron activity. Nearly $\sim 31\,$per\,cent exhibit resolved radio structures on $\sim$0.1--20\,kpc scales consistent with compact jets or wind-driven outflows, and $\sim 90\,$per\,cent display steep spectra ($\alpha \lesssim -1$) indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission. Combining morphology, spectral index and brightness-temperature diagnostics, at least $\sim38\,$per\,cent of the sample show clear AGN signatures that cannot be explained by star formation alone. These constitute the first results from the expanded QFeedS (now 71 quasars spanning $\approx 4$ dex in radio power) and demonstrate that compact, low-power jets and AGN shocks are common deep inside the radio-quiet regime. A thorough understanding of feedback processes from quasars, deep into the `radio-quiet' regime, will be obtained by connecting these high resolution radio observations with multi-wavelength observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09218v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Second CHIME/FRB Catalog of Fast Radio Bursts</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09399</link><description>arXiv:2601.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 4539 fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope between 25 July 2018 and 15 September 2023. These bursts originate from 3641 unique sources, including 981 bursts from 83 known repeating sources. For each FRB, the catalog provides a $O(10')$ estimate of sky location along with corresponding measurements of cumulative exposure time and survey sensitivity over the observing period. It includes a total-intensity dynamic spectrum between 400 and 800 MHz at 0.983 ms resolution. From this spectrum, we constrain a model of the burst morphology and measure key parameters such as arrival time, intrinsic temporal width, dispersion measure, scattering time, and flux density. This second catalog includes all FRBs from the first catalog, with every event reprocessed using a uniform and improved analysis framework. We show that previously published inferences remain valid under the updated measurements. We assess consistency of the detection rate across observational parameters, present initial distributions of burst properties, and outline ongoing and future studies that will use this catalog to investigate the nature of FRBs and their utility as astrophysical and cosmological probes.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09399v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Piecewise Power-Law Reconstruction of the Gravitational-Wave Background</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09481</link><description>arXiv:2601.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra -- especially those of cosmological origin -- than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09481v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Resolving Hubble tension and locating missing baryons: Synergies between fast radio bursts and emerging cosmological probes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09521</link><description>arXiv:2601.09521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two of the most pressing challenges in cosmology are the persistent discrepancy in measurements of the Hubble constant, referred to as the Hubble tension, and the deficit of baryons in the local Universe, known as the missing baryon problem. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ better than ($1\%$, $1\%$) in the $\Lambda$CDM model, ($1.5\%$, $2\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\%$, $3.5\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ to better than ($1\%$, $2\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09521v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Strange quark star I: the maximum gravitational mass and deformation of magnetized spinning model</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09529</link><description>arXiv:2601.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural parameters of strange quark stars (SQS) under the influence of strong magnetic fields and varying rotational frequencies. The equation of state is computed using the MIT bag model with a density-dependent bag constant and considering the Landau quantization effect regarding the strong magnetic fields up to $5\times10^{17}\,$G in the interior of SQS. Employing the LORENE library, we calculate the structural parameters under different magnetic field strengths and rotational frequencies. Our models are compared in terms of maximum gravitational mass, deformation parameter, binding energy, and compactness. Our equation of state model demonstrates that the gravitational masses are higher than those computed using a MIT bag model with a fixed bag constant. We find the gravitational masses beyond $2.3 \,M_\odot$, which are compatible with the masses of observed compact objects, such as the ``black widow'' pulsar \emph{PSR J0952-0607}, and the \emph{GW190814} event detected by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The deformation parameter and maximum gravitational mass of SQS are characterized by fitted functions accounting for variations in both magnetic field strength and rotational frequency. We find the maximum deformation parameter of 1.55 and the maximum gravitational mass of $2.8\, M_\odot$ in the fast-rotating strongly magnetized model.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09529v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Strange quark star II: the minimal and maximal gravitational mass and the Keplerian configuration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09532</link><description>arXiv:2601.09532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the MIT bag model with density-dependent bag constant for the equation of state (EOS) to estimate the gravitational mass and Keplerian frequency of rapidly rotating strange quark stars (SQS). In a companion paper we discuss the structural parameters of such rotating stars under the influence of strong magnetic fields. We use the LORENE library to compute the structural parameters at different rotational frequencies in the range of 1100-1300~Hz for a non-magnetized SQS. While there is no minimum limit for the mass of slowly rotating self-bound stars, by computing the maximum rotational frequency, known as the mass-shedding limit, we show that SQS must have a minimum mass to sustain high rotational frequencies. The mass-shedding frequency in our EOS model is lower than that estimated from the MIT bag model EOS with a fixed bag constant. The Keplerian frequency in our model depends linearly on the gravitational mass at the mass-shedding limit (and similarly on the minimum mass) with the slope of 0.08~${\rm kHz}/M_\odot$. We obtain mass limits aligned with the observational data for both the heaviest and the lightest observed pulsars.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09532v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Plasma wakes driven by Compton scattering: Non-linear regime and particle acceleration</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09596</link><description>arXiv:2601.09596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate plasma wake generation via Compton scattering from photon bursts, a non-ponderomotive process relevant when the photon wavelength is smaller than the interparticle distance but larger than the Compton wavelength. In this regime, electrons can reach relativistic velocities. We extend linear theory to the nonlinear regime, showing that plasma waves can reach the wave-breaking limit. Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing. Two-dimensional simulations reveal unique transverse fields compared to laser wakefields, with a DC magnetic field leading to consistent focusing. The work considers observational prospects in laboratory and astrophysical scenarios such as around highly luminous compact objects (e.g., pulsars, gamma-ray bursts) interacting with tenuous interstellar or intergalactic plasmas, where conditions favor Comptondominated wakefield acceleration.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09596v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Constant-roll $\beta$-exponential inflation: Palatini formalism</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09664</link><description>arXiv:2601.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the inflationary dynamics of the $\beta$-exponential potential model, where a scalar field couples to quadratic $(R + R^2)$ gravity. In this model, the inflaton is the field that determines the size of the extra dimension.

  We scan the parameter space for inflationary predictions, specifically the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, ensuring consistency with the results from ACT DR6. The compliant regions are depicted accordingly. For a suitable range of the model parameters, the values obtained for the inflationary observables align with the most recent observations by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration and/or the Planck mission.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.09664v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13673</link><description>arXiv:2411.13673v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new kilonovae. We simulate GW events assuming a data-driven distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the kilonova optical light curves. We use the simulated population of kilonovae to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of kilonova detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable kilonova to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release GW simulations and depths required to detect kilonovae based on our predictions to support the astronomical community in their multimessenger follow-up campaigns and analyses.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2411.13673v5</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Forecasting Constraints on Non-Thermal Light Massive Relics from Future CMB Experiments (CMB-S4/Simons Observatory)</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22775</link><description>arXiv:2505.22775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we present Fisher forecasts on \textit{non-thermal LiMR} models for a CMB Stage IV-like experiment and the Simons Observatory -- particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained (by a factor of $10$) for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff},M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar projected uncertainties on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.22775v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18283</link><description>arXiv:2507.18283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that this model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how a giant planet forming in the inner disk region influences the distribution and composition of second-generation planets and planetesimals in its vicinity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.18283v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Deep Synoptic Array Science: Searching for Long Duration Radio Transients with the DSA-110</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18136</link><description>arXiv:2510.18136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the design and commissioning tests for the DSA-110 Not-So-Fast Radio Burst (NSFRB) search pipeline, a 1.4GHz image-plane single-pulse search sensitive to 134ms-160.8s radio bursts. Extending the pulse width range of the FRB search by 3 orders of magnitude, the NSFRB search is sensitive to the recently-discovered Galactic Long Period Radio Transients (LPRTs or LPTs). The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the 90% completeness $25\sigma$ flux (fluence) limit to be ~1200mJy (~160Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\circ&lt;b&gt;&lt;5.7^\circ$ and $141^\circ&lt;225^\circ$ (~770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates. We estimate an upper limit Poissonian burst rate ~2 hr$^{-1}$ per square degree (~17 hr$^{-1}$} per $3^\circ\times3^\circ$ survey grid cell) maximized across the inner $|b|&lt;0.25^\circ$ of the surveyed region. By imposing the ~1200mJy flux limit on two representative models (the magnetar plastic flow model and the White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary model), we reject with 95% confidence the presence of White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary LPRTs (beamed in a detectable direction) with periods between ~10-50s within ~95% of the surveyed region. Combined with the prevalence of LPRTs in the Galactic Plane, our results motivate further consideration of both White Dwarf-M Dwarf binary models and isolated magnetar models. We will continue to explore novel LPRT search strategies during real-time operations, such as triggered periodicity searches and additional targeted surveys.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.18136v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The GAPS programme at TNG LXX.

Abstract: The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\text{B} = 19.8 \pm 0.5$ $M_\text{J}$, $e_\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\text{B} = 130^{\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.04606v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07918</link><description>arXiv:2601.07918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (``millisecond proto-magnetars'') formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow ( ~0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to ~ 30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors ~ 100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07918v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] A Submillimeter Survey of CS Excitation in Protoplanetary Disks: Evidence of X-Ray-driven Sulfur Chemistry</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae1fdf</link><description>The sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks influences the properties of nascent planets, including potential habitability. Although the inventory of sulfur molecules in disks has gradually increased over the last decade, CS is still the most commonly observed sulfur-bearing species, and it is expected to be the dominant gas-phase sulfur carrier beyond the water snow line. Despite this, few dedicated multiline observations exist, and thus, the typical disk CS chemistry is not well constrained. Moreover, it is unclear how that chemistry—and in turn, the bulk volatile sulfur reservoir—varies with stellar and disk properties. Here, we present the largest survey of CS to date, combining both new and archival observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, Submillimeter Array, and Northern Extended Millimeter Array of 12 planet-forming disks, covering a range of stellar spectral types and dust morphologies. Using these data, we derived disk-integrated CS gas excitation conditions in each source. Overall, CS chemistry appears similar across our sample with rotational temperatures of ≈10–40 K and column densities between 1012 and 1013 cm−2. CS column densities do not show strong trends with most source properties, which broadly suggests that CS chemistry is not highly sensitive to disk structure or stellar characteristics. We do, however, identify a positive correlation between stellar X-ray luminosity and CS column density, which indicates that the dominant CS formation pathway is likely via ion-neutral reactions in the upper disk layers, where X-ray-enhanced S+ and C+ drive abundant CS production. Thus, using CS as a tracer of gas-phase sulfur abundance requires a nuanced approach that accounts for its emitting region and dependence on X-ray luminosity.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae1fdf</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-identified Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2613</link><description>Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultrarelativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at a lower frequency arises at a larger radius, and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2613</guid></item><item><title>[Research in Ast] Lightcurve Features of Magnetar-powered Superluminous Supernovae with Gravitational-wave Emission and High-energy Leakage</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/ae2dec</link><description>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a distinct class of stellar explosions, exhibiting peak luminosities 10–100 times brighter than those of normal SNe. Their extreme luminosities cannot be explained by the radioactive decay of 56Ni and its daughter 56Co alone. Consequently, models invoking newly formed millisecond magnetars have been widely proposed, capable of supplying additional energy through magnetic dipole radiation. For these rapidly rotating magnetars, however, gravitational-wave (GW) emission may also significantly contribute to the spin-down, particularly during their early evolutionary stages. While high-energy photons initially remain trapped within the optically thick ejecta, they will eventually escape as the ejecta becomes transparent during the expansion, thereby influencing the late-time lightcurve. In this work, we adopt an analytical framework to systematically explore the combined effects of GW emission and high-energy leakage on the lightcurve of SLSNe. Compared to scenarios that neglect these processes, we find that for magnetars with initial spin periods of millisecond, the combined influence suppresses early-time luminosities but enhances late-time emission. We further investigate the effects of the neutron-star equation of state to the lightcurve, GW emission efficiency, ejecta mass, and other relevant quantities. Our results highlight the complex interplay between GW-driven spin-down and radiative transport in shaping the observable features of SLSNe, offering new insights into diagnosing the nature of their central engines.</description><author>Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/ae2dec</guid></item><item><title>[Publications of] SHORES.

The observations, centred at 2.1, 5.5, and 9 GHz, cover the central 0.5 deg2 of two Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) fields down to rms sensitivities of 9–17 μJy beam–1 at 2.1 GHz, 28–39 μJy beam–1 at 5.5 GHz and 38–61 μJy beam–1 at 9 GHz. This setup allows us to investigate the spectral energy distributions of faint radio sources and probe the nature of the sub-mJy population. We extract and validate a robust catalogue of 489 sources at 2.1 GHz, 101 of which are also detected at 5.5 GHz. We perform a multi-frequency analysis of the radio number counts and derive the spectral indices of sources in the deep fields. The spectral index distribution of our sources peaks around α ∼ −0.7, consistent with synchrotron emission from the faint radio population. The number counts at 2.1 GHz are consistent with previous deep surveys and theoretical models, and provide a lower limit on the star-forming galaxy (SFG) population, which is expected to dominate the faint end. The 5.5 GHz data offer new, direct constraints on the sub-mJy radio sky at higher frequencies. By cross-matching with the H-ATLAS catalogue, we identify a sample of sources with far-infrared (FIR) counterparts and explore the far-infrared-radio correlation. The sources with qFIR ≥ 1.69 exhibit radio spectral indices typical of SFGs. Furthermore, we identify a population of radio-only sources with similar indices that may correspond to high-redshift SFGs, lacking counterparts in the FIR survey due to its limited resolution and sensitivity.</description><author>Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ae2a6e</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] MUSEQuBES: Investigating the Physical and Chemical Properties of Circumgalactic Gas Around Ly$\alpha$ Emitters at $z \approx 3.3$</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07916</link><description>arXiv:2601.07916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the physical properties of absorbers associated with $z\approx3.3$ \lya\ emitters (LAEs) from the MUSEQuBES survey. Using \HI\ and ionic column densities derived from Voigt profile fitting, we determine the density and metallicity of 75 absorbers associated with 59 LAEs through a custom-built Bayesian framework. The overall sample shows a median density $\log\,(n_{\rm H}/{\rm cm^{-3}})=-2.7\pm0.7$ and metallicity \met$=-1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ with $\approx15\%$ ($\approx 40\%$ including upper limits) of systems showing metallicities consistent with the IGM at these redshifts (\met$\lesssim -2.8$). Intriguingly, absorbers with $\log\, N(\rm HI)/{\rm cm^{-2}} \gtrsim 16.5$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim 100$ at $z=3$, exhibit a bimodal metallicity distribution with peaks at \met$=-3.8\pm 0.2$ and $-1.8\pm 0.6$. The latter are observed at large impact parameters ($\gtrsim150$~pkpc) and often exhibit low-ionization species (e.g., \SiII, \AlII). We interpret the former as pristine inflowing gas from the cosmic web, while the latter likely traces metal-enriched CGM associated with outflows from faint galaxies not detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission. We find no significant correlations between absorber metallicity or density and host galaxy properties, including redshift, impact parameter, SFR, Ly$\alpha$ luminosity, or environment. Absorbers separated by $\lesssim500$~\kms\ show $\sim$1~dex metallicity and $\sim$0.5~dex density variations, indicating physical and chemical inhomogeneity of the medium around these LAEs.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07916v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07918</link><description>arXiv:2601.07918v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: The 1-100 pc region embedding long-duration gamma-ray bursts (lGRBs) has been hitherto unexplored, as extremely high ionisation by the GRB prevents application of optical absorption spectroscopy on such distances. We show that the GRB ionising flux imprints a unique time- and spatially-dependent ionisation structure on the gas, that can be probed by X-ray absorption. Application of this model to a selected sample of 7 bright GRB X-ray afterglow spectra observed by \textit{XMM-Newton} EPIC-pn enables an independent, quantitative estimation of the density (log(n) $\sim$ 2-4) and distances (5-100 pc) of the ionized absorber directly from the GRB X-ray spectrum, thereby allowing us to locate the absorbing medium of this representative sample of long GRBs in the region of the density-size diagram populated by star-forming regions versus other gravitationally bound objects in the Universe.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07919v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A persistent bow shock in a diskless magnetised accreting white dwarf</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07922</link><description>arXiv:2601.07922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07922v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The GRB Intrinsic Duration Distribution: Progenitor Insights Across Cosmic Time</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07928</link><description>arXiv:2601.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the distribution of the intrinsic duration of gamma-ray bursts' prompt emission. This expands upon the analysis of Bromberg et al., 2012 and Bromberg et al. 2013 who showed evidence for collapsar progenitors based on the presence of a plateau in the distribution of $T_{90}$, the duration over which 90 % of the prompt emission is observed for any given detector. We confirm the presence of this plateau in the distribution of duration corrected for cosmological time dilation (what we call intrinsic duration, $T_{int}$), but shifted to smaller timescales by a factor of $1/(1+z_{\rm av}) \sim 1/3$, where $z_{\rm av}$ is the average GRB redshift. More significantly, we show this plateau is only present in the sample of GRBs with redshifts greater than $(1+z) \sim 2$, and does not appear in the duration distribution of lower redshift GRBs. This result aligns with suggestions that the low redshift population of GRBs has a significant contribution from non-collapsar progenitors (while the high redshift sample is dominated by collapsars). We also show the difference in this distribution between spectrally hard and soft GRBs, confirming that a plateau is only present for the soft subset of GRBs. However, when we separate the soft GRBs into low and high redshift subsets, we find that only the high redshift soft GRBs show evidence of a plateau, while the low-redshift soft GRBs do not. This suggests there exists a significant subset of spectrally soft non-collapsar progenitors at low redshift. Finally, we use the end time of the plateau to constrain the GRB progenitor density profile and radius, and show the maximum size of a collapsar is a few tenths of a solar radius.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07928v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Galaxy interactions in void substructures: Morphology and stellar populations of two triplets from CAVITY</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07952</link><description>arXiv:2601.07952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Cosmic voids are underdense regions of the Universe that provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution in relative isolation. Galaxy triplets in voids are rare systems where local interactions may strongly influence galaxy properties.
  Aims. We study the stellar populations, morphologies, mass assembly histories, and dynamical properties of six galaxies belonging to two void triplets from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY): CAVITY5273X and VGS31.
  Methods. We used integral-field unit spectroscopy and performed full spectral fitting with the FADO code, which models stellar and nebular emission simultaneously. Spatially resolved maps of stellar age, metallicity, and star formation rate were reconstructed using the integrated nested Laplace approximation. Morphological properties were derived using morfometryka, emission-line diagnostics were applied, and mass assembly functions were computed. Stellar masses and metallicities were compared to the mass-metallicity relation for void galaxies.
  Results. The two triplets show different evolutionary behaviours. CAVITY52731 is a massive quenched galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus, while its companions and all galaxies in VGS31 are dominated by young stellar populations and recent star formation. Five galaxies experienced rapid stellar mass growth in the last 2 Gyr. Disturbed morphologies, including asymmetries and tidal features, indicate ongoing interactions. Galaxies in CAVITY5273X follow the expected void mass-metallicity relation, while VGS31 members show significant deviations.

Abstract: This letter presents an analysis of the infrared ($\sim 3-28\,\mu m$) spectra extracted from the nuclear ($r &lt; 150$ pc) regions of four low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), observed by JWST NIRSpec/IFU and MIRI/MRS as an extension of the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We find that, compared to higher-luminosity AGN, these low-luminosity AGN exhibit distinct properties in their emission of ionized gas, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). Specifically, the low-luminosity AGN exhibit relatively weak high-ionization potential lines (e.g., [Ne V] and [O IV]), and the line ratios suggest that fast radiative shocks (with $v_{\rm s}$ of $\sim \rm 100s\,km\,s^{-1}$) are the primary excitation source of ionized gas therein. Under the low-excitation conditions of their nuclear regions, these low-luminosity AGN generally exhibit a higher fraction of PAHs with large size ($N_{\rm C} \gtrsim 200$), reflecting the preferential destruction of smaller PAH molecules by AGN feedback. Furthermore, the H$_2$ transitions in these low-luminosity AGN are not fully thermalized, with slow, plausibly jet-driven molecular shocks (with $v_{\rm s} \leq \rm 10\,km\,s^{-1}$) likely being the extra excitation source. Taken together with results from the literature, these findings indicate that feedback operates in both low- and high-luminosity AGN, albeit its impact varies with AGN luminosity. In particular, systematic variations in PAH band ratios are found across AGN, demonstrating the differing influence of feedback in AGN of varying luminosities and highlighting the potential of PAH band ratios as diagnostics for distinguishing kinetic- and radiative-mode AGN feedback.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07990v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Investigating quenching in Recently Quenched Elliptical galaxies with HI studies</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08027</link><description>arXiv:2601.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Quenched Elliptical galaxies (RQEs) represent a critical phase in the transition from star-forming to quiescent galaxies. However, the mechanisms driving their quenching remain elusive. We conduct a multi-wavelength analysis of 155 RQEs, along with their precursors (preRQEs) and descendants (postRQEs), focusing on their neutral hydrogen (HI) content and star formation properties. Contrary to conventional quenching models emphasizing gas depletion, RQEs retain substantial HI reservoirs ($f_{\text{gas}} \geq 17\%$), suggesting that quenching is not primarily driven by gas exhaustion. We identify a critical halo mass threshold at $\log M_{\text{halo}} = 12.1 M_{\odot}$, delineating different evolutionary pathways for RQEs. This threshold aligns with the transition from cold-mode to hot-mode gas accretion in theoretical models. RQEs in lower-mass halos ($\log M_{\text{halo}} &lt; 12.1 M_{\odot}$) likely experience rapid quenching, possibly initiated by major mergers, followed by brief AGN activity and sustained LINER emission. We propose two evolutionary pathways: (a) rapid quenching via major mergers followed by AGN/LINER activity and passive evolution, and (b) rapid quenching followed by rejuvenation through minor mergers before evolving into more massive, long-term quenched ellipticals. These results challenge the conventional understanding of galaxy quenching, especially in low-density environments where RQEs typically reside. Our findings suggest that while RQEs may follow a rapid quenching pathway, their evolution is influenced by interactions between gas accretion modes, feedback mechanisms, and environmental factors. Future observations with advanced radio interferometers like SKA will be crucial for elucidating the quenching mechanisms in RQEs and their role in galaxy evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08027v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Long Term (250 years) Hydrodynamical Simulation of the Supermassive Black Hole Binary OJ287</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08080</link><description>arXiv:2601.08080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With upcoming facilities capable of detecting photometric and gravitational wave signals from supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries, studying their long-term accretion-driven variability is timely. OJ287 is a bright, nearby ($z=0.3$), and well-studied candidate for a SMBH binary. As such, it is an excellent case study for how binary dynamics could influence observed active galactic nucleus (AGN) photometric variability. We present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of OJ287, using the code PHANTOM. We simulate two mass ratios: (i) M$_1$ $=$ 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with M$_2$ $=$ 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$, (ii) M$_1\approx$ M$_2$ ($\sim10^{8}$ M$_\odot$) along and (iii) control of a single SMBH and accretion disc. We find that the simulation with masses 1.835$\times$10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$ and 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ M$_\odot$ evolves consistently with the most currently accepted model of OJ287 as a precessing SMBH binary. The secondary's impacts with the disc result in the formation of spiral density waves and a corresponding $\sim$10-20% increases in the mass accretion rate of the primary SMBH. The impact timings and the mass accretion rate spikes show quasi-periodic variability as a result of the precession of the secondary's orbit with intervals between impacts ranging from $\sim$ 1 year to $\sim$ 10 years. In the near-equal mass case, the disc of the primary becomes tidally disrupted after $\sim$ 2 years. Consequently, the near-equal mass system with a period of 12 years is not a viable candidate for OJ287. This modeling provides insights into the potential signatures of SMBH binaries by both gravitational wave observatories and the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08080v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Evaluating the effectiveness of radio frequency interference removal algorithms for single pulse searches</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08351</link><description>arXiv:2601.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), the presence of artificial and/or terrestrial signals in astronomical data, poses a great challenge to the search for pulsars and radio transients, such as Rotating Radio Transients (RRATs) and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), by obscuring or distorting the signal of interest and resulting in large numbers of erroneous detections. RFI mitigation algorithms aim to remove this interference and improve the chance of detection of transients, but with the growing number of techniques, selecting the most appropriate method for a given survey can be problematic. The choice of method is particularly important in real-time searches planned for next-generation telescopes such as those of the SKAO, where there is no possibility to reprocess the data. In this paper, we explore the algorithm selection problem by injecting pulses into data which simulates several RFI environments. A set of these files is then cleaned using RFI mitigation algorithms and run through a single pulse search pipeline to analyse the recovery of the injected pulses. We examine the recovery of the injected single pulses with an emphasis on a number of cases spanning a range of pulse brightness, width and dispersion measure. The efficacy and side effects of a few popular RFI excision methods, namely IQRM, SKF, and ZDMF are evaluated.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08351v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Stellar masses of optically dark galaxies: uncertainty introduced by the attenuation law and star-formation histories</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08693</link><description>arXiv:2601.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have suggested that some high-redshift galaxies may be ultra-massive, thereby challenging standard models of early galaxy formation and cosmology. We analyse the stellar masses using different modelling assumptions and with new data of three galaxies (S1, S2 and S3), whose NIRCam/grism redshifts were consistent with $z&gt;5$. These three optically dark galaxies have previously been reported to host exceptionally high stellar masses and star-formation rates, implying extremely high star-formation efficiencies. Recent NIRSpec/IFU observations for S1 indicate a spectroscopic redshift of $z_{\rm spec}=3.2461^{+0.0001}_{-0.0002}$, which is lower than previously reported. Using the Bayesian spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling tool \texttt{Prospector}, we investigate the impact of key model assumptions on stellar mass estimates, such as the choice of star-formation history (SFH) priors (constant versus rising SFH base for the non-parametric prior), the dust attenuation law, and the treatment of emission line fluxes. Our analysis yields revised stellar masses of $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \approx 10.36^{+0.47}_{-0.32}, 10.95^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ and $10.31^{+0.24}_{-0.19}$ for S1, S2, and S3, respectively. We find that adopting a rising SFH base prior results in lower inferred stellar masses compared to a constant SFH base prior. We identify a significant degeneracy between the dust attenuation curve slope, the amount of dust attenuation, and stellar mass. Our results highlight various systematics in SED modelling due to SFH priors and dust attenuation that can influence stellar mass estimates of heavily dust obscured sources. Nevertheless, even with these revised stellar mass estimates, two of the three galaxies remain among the most massive and actively star-forming systems at their respective redshifts, implying high star-formation efficiencies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08693v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Evolution and afterglow emission of gamma-ray burst jets from binary neutron star mergers</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08714</link><description>arXiv:2601.08714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic jets launched in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are widely accepted as the engines powering most of the population of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Understanding their structure and dynamics-particularly during and after breakout from the merger ejecta-is crucial for interpreting GRB afterglows, especially for off-axis observers. Traditional models often assume simple angular or radial jet profiles, potentially missing key features emerging for jets piercing through realistic environments. This work aims to investigate the formation and evolution of the jet structure as it propagates through a non-homogeneous, anisotropic BNS merger environment. We focus on how the interaction with the ambient medium shapes the jet's angular and velocity distributions and assess the impact of this realistic structure on the resulting afterglow light curves. We perform a series of 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of jets launched in post-merger environments, exploring different injection conditions. Simulations are evolved to late times, approaching the ballistic regime, where further dynamical evolution becomes negligible. From the resulting outflows, we extract energy and velocity profiles and compute multi-wavelength afterglow light curves using a semi-analytic model that includes radial stratification and the full 3D jet geometry. More energetic or earlier-launched jets drill more efficiently through the ejecta, but all develop asymmetries that leave clear imprints in the off-axis afterglow light curves. All models exhibit a complex multi-shock breakout structure responsible for an early, dimmer peak in the afterglow. Despite structural differences, all simulated jets are consistent with the observational data of the multi-messenger BNS merger event GW170817.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08714v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A precessing jet from an active galactic nucleus drives gas outflow from a disk galaxy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08791</link><description>arXiv:2601.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reproduce observed galaxy properties, cosmological simulations require that massive galaxies experience feedback from active galactic nuclei, which regulates star formation within those galaxies. However, the energetics and timescales of these feedback processes are poorly constrained. We combine optical, infrared, sub-millimeter and radio observations of the active galaxy VV 340a, hosting a low-power jet launched from a supermassive black hole at its center. We find that the jet undergoes precession, with a period of (8.2 $\pm~$5.5) $\times~$10$^5$ years, and drives an outflow of gas at a rate of 19.4 $\pm~$7.9 solar masses per year. The jet shocks the gas, producing highly ionized plasma extending several kiloparsecs from the nucleus. The outflow ejects sufficient gas from the galaxy to influence its star formation rate.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.08791v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ Gravity Compatible with ACT</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07879</link><description>arXiv:2601.07879v1 Announce Type: cross

After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,\phi)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07879v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Revisiting The Cosmological Time Dilation of Distant Quasars: Influence of Source Properties and Evolution</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04171</link><description>arXiv:2501.04171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After decades of searching, cosmological time dilation was recently identified in the timescale of variability seen in distant quasars. Here, we expand on the previous analysis to disentangle this cosmological signal from the influence of the properties of the source population, specifically the quasar bolometric luminosity and the rest-frame emission wavelength at which the variability was observed. Furthermore, we consider the potential influence of the evolution of the quasar population over cosmic time. We find that a significant intrinsic scatter of 0.288 +- 0.021 dex in the variability timescales, which was not considered in the previous analysis, is favoured by the data. This slightly increases the uncertainty in the results. However, the expected cosmological dependence of the variability timescales is confirmed to be robust to changes in the underlying assumptions. We find that the variability timescales increase smoothly with both wavelength and bolometric luminosity, and that black hole mass has no effect on the variability timescale once rest wavelength and bolometric luminosity are accounted for. Moreover, if the standard cosmological model is correct, governed by relativistic expansion, we also find very little cosmological evolution in the intrinsic variability timescales of distant quasars.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2501.04171v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Power Suppression and Lensing Anomaly -- A phenomenological investigation</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21386</link><description>arXiv:2504.21386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial power spectra with low power at long wavelengths can alleviate lensing anomaly. However the extent to which data favours such a primordial spectra is not clear. In this work, we investigate power suppression and related mitigation of lensing anomaly with the help of phenomenological models which are valid over scales of interest. We consider simple extensions to nearly scale invariant power spectra such as those which includes running and running of running of spectral index. We perform Bayesian analysis of these models, which are agnostic about power suppression, with Planck legacy data and show that data tend to choose parameters which leads to power suppression at low multipoles. We then investigate the connection between power suppression and alleviation of lensing anomaly and show that lensing anomaly is mitigated the most in models with maximum suppression of power at low multipoles. We also analyse the significance of these findings using information criteria. These results are further analyzed in the light of Planck Release 4 data using CamSpec, HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods in which departure of lensing parameter from one is significantly reduced. Furthermore, we investigate the ability of near-ultimate future CMB missions such as ECHO to put tighter constraints on these models and to settle the issue. We conclude that we can make stronger conclusions about the presence of power suppression in the future by studying such simple phenomenological models.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.21386v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The Dichotomy in the Nuclear and Host Galaxy Properties of High-redshift Quasars</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12867</link><description>arXiv:2505.12867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early growth of high-redshift quasars and their host galaxies raises critical questions about their cosmic evolution. We exploit the angular resolution and sensitivity of NIRCam to investigate the host galaxies of 31 quasars at $4\lesssim z\lesssim7$ drawn from multiple JWST surveys. Using a new multi-band forward-modeling code (\textsc{GalfitS}) that incorporates physically motivated priors, we securely detect and quantify the host emission in 30 objects, while simultaneously characterizing the nuclear spectral energy distribution. The host galaxies of high-redshift quasars are $\sim 0.3$~dex more compact than star-forming galaxies of comparable mass. A striking dichotomy emerges: luminous ``blue'' quasars ($L_{5100}\gtrsim10^{45}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) reside in bulge-dominated galaxies ($n \approx 5$) and exhibit a narrow range of ultraviolet nuclear slopes (median $\beta_{\rm UV} \approx -1.4$), while fainter ``red'' quasars inhabit disk-like hosts ($n\approx 1$) and display a broad range of slopes ($\beta_{\rm UV}\approx-2$ to 4). These two populations differ markedly in their black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, with high-luminosity quasars showing $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\ast = 1.2\%$ compared to $4.7\%$ for lower luminosity sources, placing them collectively $\sim$0.6~dex above the local $M_{\mathrm{BH}}-M_\ast$ relation. This offset likely reflects rapid black hole growth in early gas-rich environments, where feedback from the active galactic nucleus becomes effective only after substantial gas depletion. Our findings suggest that the observed dichotomy, whether due to intrinsic spectral differences or dust extinction, fundamentally shapes the coevolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies in the early Universe.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.12867v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Chasing Serendipity: Tackling Transient Sources with Neutrino Telescopes</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24652</link><description>arXiv:2505.24652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. Yet, the origin and production mechanisms of these neutrinos remain an open question. With the observation of several neutrino events with energies about the PeV, transient sources - astrophysical objects that emit particles in brief, localized bursts - have emerged as promising candidates. In this work, we revisit the identification of such sources in IceCube and future neutrino telescopes, focusing on how both the timing and sky localization of the source affect the detection sensitivity. We present a framework to account for the source's right ascension in determining the effective area of detectors not located at the poles, such as KM3NeT. As a case study, we investigate evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) as transient neutrino sources, showing that the detection prospects and localization accuracy are strongly influenced by the PBH's position in the sky. Our results emphasize the complementarity between neutrino and gamma-ray observatories and showcase the potential of a global network of neutrino detectors to identify and localize transient events that might be missed by traditional photon-based instruments.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2505.24652v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] The impact of kilonova seed photons on GRB VHE emission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21233</link><description>arXiv:2507.21233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last several years, there have been a number of GRBs with very high energy (VHE) emission in excess of 100 GeV, and even above 1 TeV, detected. In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not fully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed photon sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a source of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the kilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved using a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a kinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those found in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova seed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission when afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in structured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also benefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We apply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE spectral flux is higher than expected in previous models for the first 100 d, though still below the detection threshold.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.21233v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A $\tau-$DM relation for FRB hosts?</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13317</link><description>arXiv:2508.13317v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ($\tau$) from fast radio bursts (FRB) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between $\tau$ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the ASKAP/CRAFT survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the $\tau - $DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the $\tau - $DM relation itself, and observational biases against large $\tau$ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a $\tau - $DM$_{\rm host}$ relation is correct.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.13317v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] SN 2024hpj: A perspective on SN 2009ip-like events</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14579</link><description>arXiv:2508.14579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) IIn are terminal explosions of massive stars that are surrounded by a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). Among SNe IIn, a notable subset is the SN 2009ip-like, which exhibits an initial, fainter peak attributed to stellar variability in the late evolutionary stages, followed by a brighter peak, interpreted as the SN explosion itself. In this context, we analysed the spectrophotometric evolution of SN 2024hpj, an object with a triple-peaked light curve and spectra typical of a SN IIn but with a complex line profile composed of broad P-Cygni features topped by narrow emissions. Comparing it with other SN 2009ip-like events in the literature, as well as with other unpublished objects (SNe 2019mry, 2022ytx, 2024uzf, and 2025csc), we identify star-forming regions as their preferred formation environment. On the other hand, the diversity of spectrophotometric features within the sample suggests that variations in CSM mass and distribution may influence the observed characteristics. We identify four sub-classes based on the luminosity and rapidity of the light curve evolution, which provides insights into possible differences in the progenitors, while a statistical analysis of their observed rate indicates progenitor masses around 25 - 31 solar masses or lower.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2508.14579v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] 1.8 per cent measurement of $H_0$ from Cepheids alone</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09665</link><description>arXiv:2509.09665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most pressing problems in current cosmology is the cause of the Hubble tension. We revisit a two-rung distance ladder, composed only of Cepheid periods and magnitudes, anchor distances in the Milky Way, Large Magellanic Cloud, NGC 4258, and host galaxy redshifts. We adopt the SH0ES data for the most up-to-date and carefully vetted measurements, where the Cepheid hosts were selected to harbour also Type Ia supernovae. We introduce two important improvements: a rigorous selection modelling and a state-of-the-art density and peculiar velocity model using Manticore-Local, based on the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) algorithm. We infer $H_0 = 71.7 \pm 1.3\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, assuming the Cepheid host sample was selected by supernova magnitudes. However, the actual selection criteria are not clear, and other assumptions can increase $H_0$ by up to one statistical standard deviation. The posterior has a lower central value and a 45 per cent smaller uncertainty than a previous study using the same distance-ladder data. The result is also slightly lower than the supernova-based SH0ES inferred value of $H_0 = 73.2 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, and is in $3.3\sigma$ tension with the latest cosmic microwave background results in the standard cosmological model. These results demonstrate that a measurement of $H_0$ of sufficient precision to weigh in on the Hubble tension is achievable using second-rung data alone, underscoring the importance of robust and accurate statistical and velocity-field modelling.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.09665v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Impact of Neutrino Flavor Conversions on Neutron Star Merger Dynamics, Ejecta, Nucleosynthesis, and Multi-Messenger Signals</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15028</link><description>arXiv:2510.15028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers incorporating neutrino flavor transformations triggered by fast flavor instability, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics. In both long-lived and short-lived remnant scenarios, neutrino flavor conversions modify species-dependent neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and drive the matter towards more neutron rich conditions. They produce up to $300\%$ more neutron rich ejecta and significantly boost the r-process yields, especially in low-density, near-equatorial outflows. We identify regions unstable to fast flavor instabilities and find that these instabilities persist despite flavor conversions. We further test the sensitivity to the equilibration timescale of the flavor conversions, finding that slower flavor conversions can interact with thermodynamic equilibration, and increase the neutron richness of the ejecta. Flavor conversions may also contribute to stronger gravitational wave and neutrino emissions, pointing to a correlation between neutrino transport and merger dynamics. These results highlight the potential impact of flavor conversions while motivating future work to improve on theoretical understanding of flavor instabilities in global simulations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.15028v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] PHANGS-JWST: the largest extragalactic molecular cloud catalog traced by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06596</link><description>arXiv:2511.06596v2 Announce Type: replace

Molecular properties were inferred using a linear conversion from PAH to CO. Given the tendency for clouds in galaxy centers to overlap in velocity space, we opted to flag these and omit them from the analysis in this work. The remaining clouds correspond to giant molecular clouds, such as those detected in CO(2-1) emission by ALMA, or lower surface density clouds that either fall below the ALMA detection limits of existing maps or genuinely have no molecular counterpart. Cross-matching with ALMA CO maps at 90 pc in 27 galaxies shows that 41 % of PAH clouds have CO associations. The converted molecular properties vary little across environments, but the most massive clouds are preferentially found in spiral arms. Fitting lognormal mass distributions down to $2\times10^{3} M_{\odot}$ shows that spiral arms host the highest-mass clouds, consistent with enhanced formation in arm gravitational potentials. Cloud molecular surface densities decline by a factor of $\sim 1.5-2$ toward $2 - 3 R_{e}$. However, the trend largely varies in individual galaxies, with flat, decreasing, and even no trend as a function of galactocentric radius. Factors like large-scale processes and morphologies might influence the observed trends. We publish two catalogs online, one at the common resolution of 30 pc and another at the native resolution. We expect them to have broad utility for future PAH clouds, molecular clouds, and star formation studies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.06596v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] J-HERTz: J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at z $&lt;$ 5</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14844</link><description>arXiv:2511.14844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce J-HERTz (J-PLUS Heritage Exploration of Radio Targets at $z &lt; 5$), a new multi-wavelength catalog that combines optical narrow-band photometry from J-PLUS, infrared observations from WISE, and deep low-frequency radio data from LoTSS for nearly half a million sources across 2,100 deg$^2$ of the northern sky. Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, $\gtrsim$20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful dataset to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the AGN life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2511.14844v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A secondary orbiter under collisions with an accretion disk</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23826</link><description>arXiv:2512.23826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics of stellar orbits in dense stellar systems and nuclear star clusters (NSC) with an embedded supermassive black hole (SMBH) is governed a complex interplay of different forces. In particular, star--star gravitational collisions (relaxation), physical collisions between stars, and the hydrodynamical interaction with any surrounding gaseous environment, such as an accretion disk. These processes influence the stellar distribution, the feeding of the central black hole, and the generation of observable phenomena. Furthermore, the self-gravity of the accretion medium modulates the long-term evolution, adding significant complexity to the system's dynamics. By employing elementary arguments we outline the mentioned influences in their mutual competition.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2512.23826v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Magnetic field dynamics in presence of Hall conductivity and thermo-diffusion</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02202</link><description>arXiv:2506.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy of kinetic coefficients in presence of a magnetic field is
  represented by Hall currents, which appear in a collisional medium due to action of the Lorentz force on the charged particles between collisions.
  We derive equations, describing dynamics of the magnetic field in presence of thermo-diffusion with Hall currents, using a standard electrodynamic consideration. The influence of the Hall currents, at presence of thermo-diffusion, on the magnetic field structure is considered in simple models. The equation is derived, which includes additional term for a seed magnetic field creation in the non-magnetized plasma, due to thermo-diffusion. This equation describes the action of the seed magnetic field creation by the mechanism known as "Biermann battery".</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2506.02202v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Large-scale Environments of Low-luminosity AGNs at 3.9 &lt; z &lt; 6 and Implications for Their Host Dark Matter Halos from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae1eef</link><description>We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z = 3.9–6 in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey and First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopically Complete Observations surveys with either broad Hα emission lines or V-shaped continua, are compared to 782 Hα emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, δ, averaged over (15 h−1 cMpc)3, ranges from −0.56 to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that &gt;10 cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE autocorrelation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 h−1 cMpc and 7.66 h−1 cMpc at 3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5 and 5 &lt; z &lt; 6, respectively.

Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we present a new high-sensitivity atomic-hydrogen (H i) observation toward the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 4278 and its adjacent region. From the observation, we found that external gas accretion from a neighbouring galaxy fuels the low-luminosity AGN in NGC 4278 through tidal interactions. The accreted gas entering NGC 4278 exhibits a rotating gas disk. Moreover, the accreted galaxy has been gas poor and has an H i to stellar mass ratio of about 0.02. Due to the process of gas accretion, it is likely that relativistic jets are generated in the AGN of NGC 4278. The emission of TeV gamma rays in NGC 4278 is likely to be associated with the newly accreted H i gas.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2fbd</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Magnetic Activity in M-type Stars Based on LAMOST DR11 and TESS Observations</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae2461</link><description>We have used 898,351 M-type stellar spectra released by Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope DR11 to calculate the equivalent width of the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT) lines, the residual chromospheric emission, and the parameter , which is defined as the ratio of the luminosity of the 8542 Å line to the stellar bolometric luminosity. The chromospheric activity of M dwarfs reaches its maximum around an effective temperature of 3700 K, corresponding to a spectral type of approximately M6. The stellar photospheric activity begins to become significant at around 3800 K, and the trend gradually becomes weaker when approaching 3200 K, which may be due to the influence of the magnetic activity saturation zone. Furthermore, metallicity also influences the intensity of the chromospheric activity. We found that chromospheric and photospheric activity in M dwarfs are correlated, and that both types of activity are influenced by stellar rotation. Additionally, we crossmatched our catalog with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and identified 23,079 flare events from 3280 stars. Our results show that the majority of the M dwarf flare radiation energy is below 1036 erg, and the flare duration and energy of nearly all spectral types follow a power-law distribution, i.e., with α = 2. For the cumulative flare frequency distribution’s power-law index, we found the range to be between 1.44 and 2. We found that the power-law index α for fully convective M-type stars is approximately 1.61 ± 0.08, while for non–fully convective M-type stars, it is around 1.78 ± 0.11.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae2461</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Quantifying How Surface Complexity Influences Properties of the Solar Corona and Solar Wind</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae197a</link><description>The Sun’s magnetic field is a key driver in coronal heating and consequently solar wind acceleration.

With one such model, we explore how the spatial resolution of the surface boundary condition influences the global properties of the magnetic field and coronal heating. Using spherical harmonic decomposition, we quantify how three different resolution simulations vary in the low and middle corona. Through examination of the magnetic field, the squashing factor, and the heating rate, we demonstrate that small-scale photospheric magnetic flux enhances heating across spatial regimes. We calculate 40% more heating in our best-resolution simulation compared to our base resolution. We describe a strong correlation between the structure of the magnetic field and the structure of the heating rate in the low corona across resolutions. These results provide key information as to what more efficient, low-resolution models might inherently miss.

We develop an analytic model of line emission, demonstrating that relativistic beaming results in a broadened power-law spectral feature with a photon index of −1. We then perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations incorporating electron–positron pair production, annihilation, and Compton scattering. The dependence of the emergent spectrum on the baryon loading is also examined, showing that a baryon-poor fireball is more favorable for the detection of MeV gamma rays. We further assess the detectability of the line component. The simulation results indicate that a power-law MeV component from the initial spike of a Galactic MGF could be observed with current instruments, such as Fermi/GBM, and will be well within the reach of upcoming MeV gamma-ray satellites, which are expected to detect photons from such events.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae3289</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] New Evidence for Extragalactic Einstein Probe Transients Associated with Long Gamma-Ray Bursts</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2012</link><description>The origin of extragalactic fast X-ray transients (EFXTs) remains a fundamental open question in high-energy astrophysics.

Abstract: Exoplanet atmosphere characterization has seen revolutionary advances over the last few years, providing us with unique insights into atmospheric chemistry, dynamics and planet formation mechanisms. However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA's next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge'. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope's design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06233v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Spectral Signatures of Spinning Dust from Grain Ensembles in Diverse Environments: A Combined Theoretical and Observational Study</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06270</link><description>arXiv:2601.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of anomalous microwave emission (AME) reveal spectral features that are not readily reproduced by spinning dust models, motivating further investigation. We examine how dust grain distributions and environmental parameters determine the peak frequency and spectral width of AME spectral energy distribution (SED). Using Monte Carlo sampling and global sensitivity analysis, we find that AME features are dominantly controlled by three parameters: grain size, shape, and a phase-dependent environmental parameter. We also quantify the effects of SED broadening from ensembles of these dominant parameters, finding that the level of tension with observations is strongly phase dependent: Molecular Cloud (MC) is fully consistent, Dark Cloud (DC) shows minor deviations, and HII regions exhibit significant offsets in peak frequency. This points to possible issues in phase-dependent AME extraction, interstellar medium (ISM) environment identification, or underlying theoretical tension. Ensemble variations in both grain size and environmental parameters are required to reproduce the observed spread in peak frequency and spectral width. We further propose moment expansion and emulation-based inference methods for future AME spectral fit and feature analysis.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06270v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] CAMELS Environments: The Impact of Local Neighbours on Galaxy Evolution across the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE Simulations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06290</link><description>arXiv:2601.06290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in galaxy evolution, but external environmental effects can also strongly influence galaxies. We investigate the impact of environment on galaxy evolution, and its dependence on baryonic physics implementation, using Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) spanning a wide range of stellar and AGN feedback implementations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. We show that satellite galaxies are significantly affected by the environment in all simulation models, with their gas fraction and star formation rate (SFR) suppressed in overdense regions compared to similar mass satellites in underdense environments at $z=0$. Central galaxies are less sensitive to environment but tend to show lower gas fraction and SFR in overdense regions at low stellar mass, transitioning to higher gas fraction and SFR for massive galaxies in higher-density environments. Halo baryon fraction ($f_{\rm B}$) and circumgalactic medium mass fraction ($f_{\rm CGM}$) at $z=0$ show clear environmental effects. In SIMBA, low-mass haloes in overdense regions have systematically lower $f_{\rm B}$ and $f_{\rm CGM}$ at fixed halo mass, while Swift-EAGLE haloes in overdense regions have systematically higher $f_{\rm B}$ and $f_{\rm CGM}$ across the full halo mass range, and IllustrisTNG and ASTRID show opposite trends at the low and high mass ends. Environmental effects can flip at higher redshift, with SFR and $f_{\rm B}$ increasing with local density in low-mass haloes before quenching at an increasing overdensity threshold. Our results demonstrate that the impact of environment on galaxy evolution depends significantly on galaxy formation model, and higher-density environments can either suppress or enhance star formation depending on galaxy mass and cosmic epoch.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06290v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Collision between molecular clouds IV: The role of feedback and magnetic field in head on collisions</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06355</link><description>arXiv:2601.06355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate how cloud-cloud collisions influence star formation, emphasizing the roles of collision velocity, magnetic field orientation, and radiative feedback. Using the first cloud-cloud collision simulations that model individual star formation and accretion with all stellar feedback mechanisms, we explore the morphological evolution, star formation efficiency (SFE), fragmentation, stellar mass distribution, and feedback-driven gas dispersal. Our results show that cloud collisions substantially enhance the rate and timing of star formation compared to isolated scenarios, though the final SFE remains broadly similar across all setups. Lower collision velocities facilitate prolonged gravitational interaction and accumulation of gas, promoting sustained star formation characterized by elongated filamentary structures. Conversely, high-velocity collisions induce rapid gas compression and turbulent motions, leading to intense but transient episodes of star formation, which are curtailed by feedback-driven dispersal. The orientation of the magnetic field markedly affects collision outcomes. Parallel fields allow gas to collapse efficiently along magnetic lines, forming fewer but more massive stars. In contrast, perpendicular fields generate significant magnetic pressure, which stabilizes the shock-compressed gas and delays gravitational collapse, resulting in more distributed and less massive stellar fragments. Radiative feedback from massive stars consistently regulates star formation, halting further gas accretion at moderate efficiencies (10-15%) and initiating feedback-driven dispersal. Although the cloud dynamics vary significantly, the stellar mass function remains robust across scenarios-shaped modestly by magnetic orientation but only weakly influenced by collision velocity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06355v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Constraining Inflation Models with Spinning Voids</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06589</link><description>arXiv:2601.06589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a powerful new diagnostics by which the running of scalar spectral index of primordial density fluctuations can be tightly and independently constrained. This new diagnostics utilizes coherent rotation of void galaxies, which can be observed as redshift asymmetry in opposite sides dichotomized by the projected spin axes of hosting voids. Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $\Lambda$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06589v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Turbulent Properties of Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections Observed by Solar Orbiter in the Inner Heliosphere</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06904</link><description>arXiv:2601.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the turbulent properties of 12 interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) observed by Solar Orbiter between 0.29 and 1.0 AU. We analyze fluctuation power, spectral indices, break scales, and correlations between magnetic and velocity fluctuations (v-b) to quantify differences between ICME substructures (sheath and magnetic ejecta (ME)) and the surrounding solar wind. The ICME sheath is consistently the most turbulent region at all distances. In the solar wind, Alfv\'enicity influences inertial-range scaling, resulting in either single power laws near f^-3/2 or f^-5/3, or a coexistence of both, whereas ICME substructures consistently exhibit Kolmogorov-like f^-5/3 spectra. Alfv\'enicity is reduced within ICMEs, particularly in the ejecta, indicating more balanced Alfv\'enic fluctuations than in the solar wind. Spectral breaks shift to higher frequencies in ICME regions, with average break frequencies of 0.53 +/- 0.35 Hz (solar wind), 1.87 +/- 1.46 Hz (sheath), and 1.46 +/- 1.28 Hz (ME), reflecting differences in underlying microphysical scales. Our findings highlight distinct turbulence regimes in ICMEs compared to the solar wind and support the use of fluctuation power, spectral breaks, and v-b correlations as effective diagnostics for identifying ICME boundaries.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06904v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] More power on large scales</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07106</link><description>arXiv:2601.07106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high value of the cosmic microwave dipole may be telling us that dark matter is macroscopic rather than a fundamental particle. The possible presence of a significant dark matter component in the form of primordial black holes suggests that dark halo formation simulations should be commenced well before redshift z = 100. Unlike standard CDM candidates, PBHs behave as dense, non-relativistic matter from their inception in the radiation-dominated era. This allows them to seed gravitational potential wells and begin clustering earlier. We find that starting N-body simulations at redshifts even before matter-radiation equality yield galaxy bulk flow velocities that are systematically larger than those predicted by standard LCDM models. The early, high-mass concentrations established by PBHs lead to a more rapid and efficient gravitational acceleration of surrounding baryonic and dark matter, generating larger peculiar velocities that remain coherent over scales of hundreds of Mpc. Furthermore, a sub-population of PBHs in the 10^-20 to 10^-17 solar mass range would lose a non-negligible fraction of their mass via Hawking radiation over cosmological timescales. This evaporation process converts matter into radiation, so a time-varying matter density parameter, Omega_m', is introduced, which behaves like a boosted radiation term in the Friedmann equation. This dynamic term acts to reduce the Hubble tension. A higher effective Omega_r in the early universe reduces the sound horizon at the epoch of recombination. PBH mass loss also influences fits to the equation of state parameter, w, at low redshift. The naive N-body modelling presented here suggests investigation with tried and tested cosmology codes should be carried out, by introducing mass losing PBHs and starting the evolution as early as practicable.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07106v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A Study Revealing Physical Attributes of Supernova Remnant in G321.3-3.9</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07170</link><description>arXiv:2601.07170v1 Announce Type: new

Abstract: Magnetars are the most strongly magnetized compact objects known in the Universe and are regarded as one of the primary engines powering a variety of enigmatic, high-energy transients. However, our understanding of magnetars remains highly limited, constrained by observational sample size and radiative variability. XTE~J1810$-$197, which re-entered a radio-active phase in 2018, is one of only six known radio-pulsating magnetars. Leveraging the distinctive capability for simultaneous dual-frequency observations, we utilized the Shanghai Tianma Radio Telescope (TMRT) to monitor this magnetar continuously at both 2.25 and 8.60~GHz, capturing its entire evolution from radio activation to quenching. This enabled precise characterization of the evolution in its integrated profile, spin frequency, flux density, and spectral index ($\alpha$, defined by $S \propto f^{\alpha}$). The first time derivative of its spin frequency $\dot{\nu}$ passed through four distinct phases -- rapid decrease, violent oscillation, steady decline, and stable recovery -- before returning to its pre-outburst value concomitant with the cessation of radio emission. Remarkably, both the amplitudes and the characteristic time-scales of these $\dot{\nu}$ variations match those observed during the previous outburst that began in 2003, providing the first demonstration that post-outburst rotational evolution and radiative behavior in a magnetar are repeatable. A twisted-magnetosphere model can qualitatively account for this repeatability as well as for the progressive narrowing and abrupt disappearance of the radio pulse radiation, thereby receiving strong observational support.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07173v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Photometric Redshift Estimation Using Scaled Ensemble Learning</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07292</link><description>arXiv:2601.07292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of the state-of-the-art telescopic systems capable of performing expansive sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Euclid, and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) has significantly advanced efforts to refine cosmological models. These advances offer deeper insight into persistent challenges in astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe's evolution. A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z ~ 4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope. Our results show marked improvements in the precision and reliability of Pz estimation. Furthermore, this approach closely adheres to-and in certain instances exceeds-the benchmarks specified in the LSST Science Requirements Document. Evaluation metrics include catastrophic outlier, bias, and rms.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07292v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Modified Gravity and the Origin of the Excess Radio Galaxy Number-Count Dipole</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07487</link><description>arXiv:2601.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent analyses of wide-area radio-galaxy surveys have reported a statistically significant excess in the cosmic number-count dipole, with an amplitude exceeding the purely kinematic expectation of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by a factor of $\sim 3$--$4$, quoted at a significance level of up to $5.4\sigma$. While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $\Lambda$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar--Tensor--Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07487v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Galaxy Mergers in UNIONS -- II: Predicting Timescales in the Post-Merger Regime</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07604</link><description>arXiv:2601.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers are critical events that influence galaxy evolution by driving processes such as enhanced star formation, quenching, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. However, constraining the timescales over which these processes occur in the post-merger phase has remained a significant challenge. This study extends the MUlti-Model Merger Identifier (\textsc{Mummi}) framework to predict post-merger timescales ($T_{PM}$) for galaxies, leveraging machine learning models trained on realism-enhanced mock observations derived from the IllustrisTNG simulations. By classifying post-merger galaxies into four temporal bins spanning 0 to 1.76 Gyr after coalescence, \textsc{Mummi} achieves time classification accuracies exceeding 70 per cent. We apply this framework to the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), yielding a catalog of 8,716 post-merger galaxies with $T_{PM}$ predictions and stellar masses $\log(M_*/M_\odot) \geq 10$ at redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.3. These results provide a robust methodology to connect galaxy interaction timescales with physical processes, enabling detailed studies of galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07604v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Brightest GRB flare observed in GRB 221009A: bridge the last gap between flare and prompt emission in GRB</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07688</link><description>arXiv:2601.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phase of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in soft X-ray, optical and radio bands, but rarely in gamma-ray band. Despite the extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso} = 1.82 \times 10^{53}$ erg of GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, $E_{\rm peak} \sim 300$ keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in soft X-ray or optical band, but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV-MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, which bridges the last gap between prompt emission and flare.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07688v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] A COLIBRI Photometric Study of SN 2025bvm: A Normal, Slowly Declining Type Ia Supernova</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07745</link><description>arXiv:2601.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 121 days of multi-band (\Bband, \gband, \rband, \iband) optical photometry of the Type Ia supernova SN 2025bvm, obtained with the COLIBRI telescope at OAN-SPM. The light curves show a photometric decline of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 0.867 \pm 0.051$~mag, characteristic of a slow-declining Type Ia supernova. After correcting for host galaxy extinction ($E(B-V)_{host} = 0.308 \pm 0.030$~mag) and adopting a distance of 70~Mpc, we derive a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -19.13 \pm 0.40$~mag. This luminosity is fully consistent with its slow decline rate, placing SN 2025bvm within the population of normal Type Ia supernovae. We conclude that SN 2025bvm is a normal Type Ia supernova, whose photometric properties, such as a slow late-time decline and a prominent \iband-band secondary maximum, suggest an explosion that resulted in a particularly massive ejecta.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07745v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Cosmoglobe DR2.

Abstract: We present a model of starlight emission in the Diffuse Infrared Background Explorer (DIRBE) data between 1.25 and 25$\,\mu$m based on \textit{Gaia} and WISE measurements. We include two classes of compact objects, namely bright stars with individual spectral energy densities (SEDs) measured by \textit{Gaia}, and a combined diffuse background of dim point source emission. Of the 424\ 829 bright sources that we fit, the number of stars with a flux density detected by WISE at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;20^{\circ}$ at more than $5\,\sigma$ is 94\,680, for an average of 1.36~stars per DIRBE beam area. For each star, we adopt physical parameters ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and [M/H]) from \textit{Gaia}; use these to identify a best-fit effective SED with the PHOENIX stellar model library; convolve with the respective DIRBE bandpass; and fit an overall free amplitude per star within the Bayesian end-to-end \texttt{Cosmoglobe} DR2 framework. The contributions from faint sources are accounted for by coadding all 710\ 825\ 587 WISE sources not included as bright stars, and fit one single overall amplitude per DIRBE band. Based on this model we find that total star emission accounts for 91\,\% of the observed flux density at 2.2\,$\mu$m; 54\,\% at 4.9$\,\mu$m; and 1\,\% at 25\,$\mu$m. As shown in companion papers, this new model is sufficiently accurate to support high-precision measurements of both the Cosmic Infrared Background monopole and zodiacal light emission in the three highest DIRBE frequencies.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.07831v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Strong Einstein-Hilbert Gravity Inflation and ACT Phenomenology</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06946</link><description>arXiv:2601.06946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study rescaled effective single scalar field theories, and we confront these with the ACT constraint on the spectral index of the scalar primordial perturbations and the updated BICEP/Planck constraint on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. Rescaled scalar theories of gravity may be the result of an effective $f(R,\phi)$ gravity at strong curvature regimes, which may result on a rescaling of the Einstein-Hilbert term of the form $\sim \alpha R$. It turns out that canonical scalar field theories with stronger gravity compared to standard Einstein-Hilbert gravity can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints, with stronger gravity meaning that the rescaling parameter $\alpha$ takes values smaller than unity.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06946v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Viable f(R) Scenarios Unifying Inflation with Realistic Dynamical Dark Energy</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06949</link><description>arXiv:2601.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}&gt;0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $\chi^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.06949v1</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Confronting Mukhanov Parametrization of Inflationary Equation-of-State with ACT-DR6</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05648</link><description>arXiv:2507.05648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a simple yet effective semi-analytical approach to confront Mukhanov Parametrization of inflationary equation-of-state, $1+\omega =\frac{\beta}{({N}+1)^\alpha}$, with the latest ACT-DR6 data employing Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. We find that equation-of-state formalism comes up with excellent fit to the latest data. In the process we are also able to put stringent constraint on the two model parameters. In order to get the bounds of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have also made use of the recent finding $r&lt;0.032$. We have further utilized results from the joint analysis of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to find the observationally viable region for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. We have also employed the predictions on primordial gravity waves from forthcoming CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD along with results from the combination of ACT-DR6, Planck-2018 and DESI-Y1 data to further restrict the model parameters. We find that detection of gravity waves would help us narrow the viable parameter space for Mukhanov parametrization. But in the absence of detection of primordial gravity waves signal by those CMB missions parameter space is reduced significantly for $\beta$, while the range for $\alpha$ is slightly increased. In addition we observe that, $\alpha$ is primarily dependent on the observationally viable range for scalar spectral index while other model parameter $\beta$ is resting heavily on the restriction upon the amplitude of primordial gravity waves. We find that equation-of-state formalism has a wide range of parameter values consistent with recent observational data set along with futuristic CMB missions in the likes of CMB-S4 and LiteBIRD.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2507.05648v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Measuring the Central Dark Mass in NGC 4258 with JWST/NIRSpec Stellar Kinematics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20519</link><description>arXiv:2509.20519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central $3'' \times 3''$. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1$\sigma$) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.08^{+0.19}_{-0.33}) \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2509.20519v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Implications of Joint Spectral Analysis of Gamma-Ray Bursts detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on Phenomenological Correlations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16475</link><description>arXiv:2510.16475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes for exploring the distant Universe, owing to their immense luminosities and detectability at high redshifts. Several empirical correlations have been established, particularly involving their energy properties. This work aims to enhance the precision of these correlations through joint spectral analysis, focusing on reducing uncertainties in both the spectral indices and the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) derived from spectral fitting. We extend previous studies using both traditional and novel spectral models, utilizing a sample of 37 GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT), incorporating the LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique, over the period 2008-2024. Our analysis compares results from joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) against those from GBM-only fits. The study focuses on fitting time-integrated ${\rm T}_{90}$ and peak flux in the rest frame. Among the observable phenomenological correlations, we revisit the Amati and Yonetoku relations: the Amati relation links the intrinsic peak energy ($E_{i,\rm p}$) to the total isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) emitted during ${\rm T}_{90}$, while the Yonetoku relation connects $E_{i,\rm p}$ to the isotropic luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$). Refining these correlations aims to deepen our understanding of GRB energetics and improve the precision of cosmological parameter estimates derived from GRB observations.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.16475v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Stellar Wind-Blown Bubbles as Environments for Late-Time Rebrightening of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22891</link><description>arXiv:2510.22891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We presented the multi-wavelength afterglow fitting results for three events that exhibit late afterglow rebrightening behavior: EP240414a ($z=0.401$), GRB 240529A ($z=2.695$), and GRB 240218A ($z=6.782$), which span a broad range of redshifts, from the local to the high-redshift universe.We prove that the peculiar afterglow light curves of three bursts can be well fitted by structured jets propagated in free-to-shocked stellar wind environment of stellar wind blown bubbles. This scenario offers a self-consistent explanation for the observed subclass of afterglows that exhibit rebrightening that is characterized by steep rises and rapid decays. It also provides a unified solution for such events and offers pathways to study both the jet generation mechanism and the propagation process of jets through the envelope of the progenitor. This study reveals that the structured jets produced by such events exhibit a narrow jet core and a steep angle-dependent energy decay index, suggesting highly magnetized jets. The derived transition radii from free stellar winds to shocked stellar winds for all three events are smaller than 0.5 pc, with statistical analysis of similar events indicating a median value of 0.1 pc, which conflicts with numerical simulation results. We anticipate that future observations by EP and SVOM missions will enhance the understanding of analogous events and further reveal information about progenitors and their circum-environments.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2510.22891v2</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Sound waves from primordial black hole formations</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12243</link><description>arXiv:2504.12243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from associated sound waves.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2504.12243v3</guid></item><item><title>[astro-ph update] Machine learning for radiative hydrodynamics in astrophysics</title><link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05155</link><description>arXiv:2601.05155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.
  Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.
  The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.
  The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.</description><author>astro-ph updates on arXiv.org</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 05:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">oai:arXiv.org:2601.05155v2</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Bistability, Oscillations, and Multistability on Hycean Planets</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae18d7</link><description>Hycean planets are hypothetical exoplanets characterized by H2O oceans and H2-rich atmospheres. These planets are high-priority targets for biosignature searches, as they combine abundant surface liquid water with easy-to-characterize H2-rich atmospheres. Perhaps their most unusual climate feature is convective inhibition, which can dramatically alter a planet’s temperature structure. However, so far, hycean planets have mostly been investigated using 1D models that do not account for convective inhibition, and its effects are still poorly understood. This work develops pen-and-paper theory to analyze the effects of moist convective inhibition on hycean planets. The theory is tested and verified against a 1D radiative–convective model. We show that hycean planets near the onset of convective inhibition can exhibit either bistability or oscillations, due to the inhibition layer’s trapping of heat and moisture. Meanwhile, hot hycean planets exhibit multistability, in which the inhibition layer and surface climate show multiple stable equilibria due to the lack of constraints on the water cycle inside the inhibition layer. The water cycle inside the inhibition layer is influenced by numerous processes that are challenging to resolve in 1D, including turbulent diffusion, convective overshoot, and large-scale circulations. Our results demonstrate that hycean planets have unexpectedly rich climate dynamics. Meanwhile, previous claims about hycean planets should be treated with caution until confirmed with more self-consistent 1D and 3D models; this includes the claim that K2-18b might be habitable, as well as the proposal to infer H2O oceans on sub-Neptunes from JWST measurements of chemical species in their upper atmospheres.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae18d7</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Relation between AGN and Host Galaxy Properties in the JWST Era.

This expanded study of one of the largest and most complete, multiwavelength samples of AGN detected at 0.6 &lt; z &lt; 3.8 in the GOODS-South and -North fields, confirms that mergers surprisingly play a significant role in obscured, subquasar AGN host galaxies. Additionally, the pattern of morphological disturbances observed amongst the X-ray- and mid-IR-selected AGN suggests that these represent different phases of AGN evolution tied to a major-merger timeline, as opposed to distinct populations of AGN.

FrankenBlast associates transients to their host galaxies, performs host photometry, and runs a innovative spectral energy distribution fitting code to constrain host stellar population properties—all within minutes per object. We test FrankenBlast on 14,432 supernovae (SNe), ≈half of which are spectroscopically classified, and are able to constrain host properties for 9262 events. When contrasting the host stellar masses (M*), specific star formation rates (sSFR), and host dust extinction (AV) between spectroscopically and photometrically classified SNe Ia, Ib/c, II, and IIn, we determine that deviations in these distributions are primarily due to misclassified events contaminating the photometrically classified sample. We further show that the higher redshifts of the photometrically classified sample also force their M* and sSFR distributions to deviate from those of the spectroscopically classified sample, as these properties are redshift-dependent. We compare host properties between spectroscopically classified SN populations and determine if they primarily trace M* or SFR. We find that all SN populations seem to both depend on M* and SFR, with SNe II and IIn somewhat more SFR-dependent than SNe Ia and Ib/c, and SNe Ia more M*-dependent than all other classes. We find the difference in the SNe Ib/c and II hosts to be the most intriguing and speculate that SNe Ib/c must be more dependent on higher M* and more evolved environments for the right conditions for progenitor formation.

In general, PA jumps can arise from the coherent or incoherent superposition of two electromagnetic waves, with the total polarization fraction remaining constant in the former and not in the latter. The observations seem to be more consistent with incoherent superposition. The amplitudes of the two orthogonal modes are required to be comparable when jumps occur. We provide general constraints on FRB emission and propagation mechanisms based on the data. Physically, it is difficult to produce PA jumps through switching the dominance of the two orthogonal modes within millisecond timescales, and a geometric effect due to rotation of the source is more plausible. This requires that the emission region be within the magnetosphere of a spinning central engine, likely a magnetar. The two orthogonal modes in different directions can arise when the rotation of the source brings two independent emission regions with different dominant modes successively into the line of sight, due to either intrinsic radiation mechanisms or the O-mode undergoing a delayed transparency because of the Alfvén–O-mode conversion. Splitting of emission directions for the two modes due to plasma birefringence is not easy to achieve when the plasma is moving relativistically. For intrinsic radiation mechanisms, curvature radiation always predicts ∣EX/EO∣ ≳ 1, and it is difficult to produce jumps; whereas inverse Compton scattering can achieve the conversion amplitude ratio ∣EX/EO∣ = 1 to allow jumps to occur under special geometric configurations.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae285e</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Signatures of Magnetic Flux Expulsion from Neutron Star Cores</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae31f5</link><description>Shortly after a neutron star is born, the protons in its core begin to form a superconductor. In terrestrial materials, the hallmark of superconductivity is an associated expulsion of magnetic flux, but whether this expulsion process can be effective in neutron stars remains an open question—one with major implications for the phenomenology of pulsars and magnetars. Earlier theoretical arguments suggested flux must be trapped within the core, yet models of magnetars rely on it being expelled from the core and confined to the crust, where it can evolve on kiloyear timescales. We show that if expulsion is not complete, a qualitatively new evolutionary branch for neutron stars arises, which can account for the properties of newly discovered long-period radio transients and fast radio bursts in older environments. One recently proposed model that could create such field topologies has additional implications for gravitational-wave emission and predicts a characteristic energy release that, if observed, will corroborate the role of reconnection at the onset of superconductivity and can constrain the superconducting proton gap.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae31f5</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Connecting Environment, Star Formation History, and Morphology of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at 3 &lt; z &lt; 4 with JWST</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae0a18</link><description>We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies ( ) at 3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.3, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using Sérsic profile fits to F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size–mass relation and find typical sizes of ∼0.6–0.8 kpc at M* = 5 × 1010M⊙, consistent with ∼7× growth from z ∼ 4 to the present, including ∼2× by z ∼ 2. We find tentative evidence that formation history and morphology jointly influence galaxy sizes: late-forming bulge-dominated galaxies appear more compact by ∼0.2–0.3 dex relative to the expected relation, while late-forming disk-dominated galaxies are larger. Using a Random Forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by from the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio (B/T), which spans 0.25–1. In the IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex situ stellar mass fraction (f*,ex situ)—a proxy for mergers—is instead the dominant predictor of B/T. Galaxies with high B/T in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales (≲0.4 Gyr), consistent with bulge growth through merger-driven starbursts; in simulations, such systems exhibit elevated ex situ fractions (∼20%–30%). In contrast, some high-B/T galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex situ fractions, suggesting that additional processes—such as violent disk instabilities—also contribute. These results point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and active galactic nucleus feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae0a18</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] AGN STORM 2.

We present results from 157 near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of ∼90 lt-days from the blackbody dust temperature light curve. This radius is consistent with previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant “dusty wall” of a carbonaceous composition. Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident radiation, we derive a luminosity of ∼6 × 1044 erg s−1 for the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate of . Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured lower luminosity disk with , which permits the UV–optical continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on scales ≳ 140–350 pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we observe in spatially resolved [S III] λ9531 images. Its likely origin is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by a nuclear starburst.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae17cd</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Tidally Driven Inertial Waves Enhance Eccentricity Damping and Spin Evolution in Planets and Stars</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae18ca</link><description>Tidal interactions influence the orbital motions of binary star systems and extrasolar planets alike. Tides also affect stellar and planetary rotation rates. We demonstrate that in addition to altering spin synchronization and pseudosynchronization, tidally driven inertial waves in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and gas-giant planets can enhance tidal eccentricity damping. Analytically, we find that eccentricity damping by inertial waves can be orders of magnitude faster than equilibrium tides, independent of any eddy viscosity prescription. We use simplified numerical experiments to demonstrate this enhancement and to explore the effects of different mixing-length treatments of convective turbulence, as well as a spindown torque from magnetic braking. These calculations demonstrate that tidally driven inertial waves can produce an extended cool core of nearly circular binaries, helping to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy between observed and predicted main-sequence binary circularization. Our calculations additionally suggest that tidally driven inertial waves may leave identifiable signatures in the ratios of the orbital to rotation periods for stellar binaries, including synchronous and subsynchronous rotation periods reminiscent of populations identified in Kepler, TESS, and Gaia data.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae18ca</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Preferential Positron Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetized Electron–Positron–Ion Shocks</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae246b</link><description>Relativistic shocks are considered efficient accelerators of charged particles and play crucial roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts and pulsar winds.

Test particle simulations revealed that the selective acceleration occurs for sufficiently large amplitudes of the wakefield. The mechanism can be understood as the relativistic E × B acceleration formulated in the upstream frame. A theoretical analysis of the positron acceleration in astrophysical contexts is presented, supporting ultrarelativistic shocks in pulsar winds as a primary source for the high-energy positron excess.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae246b</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Robust Extraction of Global 21 cm Spectrum from Experiments with a Chromatic Beam Based on Physics-motivated Error Modeling</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25ee</link><description>The extraction of the sky-averaged 21 cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization faces significant challenges. The bright and anisotropic Galactic foreground, which is 4–5 orders of magnitude brighter than the 21 cm signal, when convolved with the inevitably chromatic beam, introduces additional spectral structures that can easily mimic the real 21 cm signal. In this paper, we investigate the signal extraction for a lunar-orbit experiment, where the antenna moves fast in orbit and data from multiple orbits have to be used. We propose a physics-motivated and correlated modeling of both the foreground and the measurement errors. By dividing the sky into multiple regions according to the spectral index distribution and accounting for the full covariance of modeling errors, we jointly fit both the foreground and the 21 cm signal using simulated data for the Discovering the Sky at the Longest wavelength lunar orbit experiment. This method successfully extracts the 21 cm signals of various amplitudes from the simulated data even for a testing antenna with a relatively high level of chromaticity. This approach, which is robust against moderate beam chromaticity, significantly relaxes the stringent design and manufacturing requirements for the antenna, offering a practical solution for future 21 cm global signal experiments either on the ground or in space.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25ee</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Ubiquity of Methanol and Its Related Chemical Segregation in Orion Starless Cores: The ALMASOP Sample</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25fd</link><description>Complex organic molecules (COMs) in starless cores provide critical insights into the early stages of star formation and prebiotic chemistry. We present a chemical survey of 16 starless cores (including five prestellar cores) in the Orion A and B molecular clouds, targeting CH3OH, N2H+, CCS, and c-C3HD, using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and the Yebes 40 m telescope. CH3OH was detected toward all targets, confirming its ubiquity in starless cores, consistent with previous surveys in Taurus and Perseus. ACA imaging shows that CH3OH, CCS, and c-C3HD generally trace the outer layers of the dense cores outlined by N2H+, each exhibiting distinct spatial distributions. Meanwhile, comparison with Yebes data reveals an extended, flattened CH3OH component. CCS and c-C3HD tend to be detected or nondetected together across cores, while cores near dust-rich regions on a large scale often lack both, suggesting environmental influences linked to the interstellar radiation field. Within individual cores, CCS typically resides in an outer layer relative to c-C3HD. Our findings underscore the importance of high-resolution studies for understanding the origins and spatial differentiation of COMs and carbon-chain molecules in cold, quiescent environments.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae25fd</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Ultradiffuse Galaxies in the EAGLE Simulation</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae260f</link><description>We use the highest-resolution EAGLE simulation, Recal-L025N0752, to study the properties and formation of ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs). We identify 181 UDGs at z = 0 and find their properties are consistent with observations. The total masses of the EAGLE UDGs range from ∼5 × 108M⊙ to ∼2 × 1011M⊙, indicating that they are dwarf galaxies rather than failed L⋆ galaxies. The EAGLE UDGs are not a distinct population, but rather a subset of dwarf galaxies, as their properties generally form a continuous distribution with those of normal dwarf galaxies. Unlike most of the situations in previous studies, the extended sizes of the field UDGs in EAGLE are not driven by high halo spins or by supernova-induced stellar expansion, but instead largely arise from high spins in their star-forming gas and thus the newly formed stars at large radii. We hypothesize that this might be attributed to galactic fountains, via which star-forming gas is launched to large halocentric distances and acquires additional angular momentum through interactions with the circumgalactic medium. For satellite UDGs, ∼60% of them were already UDGs before falling into the host galaxy, while the remaining ∼40% were normal galaxies prior to infall and subsequently transformed into UDGs due to tidal effects after infall.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae260f</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Consistent Modeling of Nonequilibrium Dust Sublimation and the Interactions with Dust Evolution in the Inner Regions of Protoplanetary Disks</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2683</link><description>The inner regions of protoplanetary disks are host to the sublimation of dust grains, a process traditionally modeled using equilibrium thermodynamics. We demonstrate through ab initio density functional theory and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that silicate dust sublimation is inherently a nonequilibrium kinetic process. The binding energies and vibrational frequencies governing desorption, calculated for MgSiO3 and other compositions, reveal that sublimation timescales far exceed local dynamical times, allowing grains to persist in a superheated state. This kinetic inhibition results in a broad, dynamic sublimation front whose location and morphology are strongly regulated by radial advection and dust coagulation. Our coupled simulations, integrating sublimation with advection and grain evolution, show that the front varies radially by a factor of four with accretion rate and exhibits a vertically stratified, bowl-shaped structure. These findings imply that the inner disk’s dust distribution, thermal structure, and subsequent planet formation are profoundly influenced by the kinematics and kinetics of dust grains, necessitating a departure from equilibrium prescriptions in disk models and interpretations of inner rim observations.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae2683</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Chemical Enrichment of Metal-poor Stars Orbiting Massive Black Hole Companions</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae28c6</link><description>There are millions of undetected black holes wandering through our galaxy. Observatories like Chandra, LIGO, and more recently, Gaia, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion’s metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundance, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still on the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the Gaia BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process is likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of Sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae28c6</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] Bayesian Analysis of Wave-optics Gravitationally Lensed Massive Black Hole Binaries with a Space-based Gravitational-wave Detector</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29ad</link><description>Within a Bayesian statistical framework, we jointly estimate the source and lens parameters and evaluate the relative evidence between the lensed and unlensed models. We investigate the wave-optics effects induced by a point-mass lens on gravitational waves (GWs) from massive binary black holes with comparable component masses (q = 0.9) and assess the capability of the space-based GW detector Taiji to detect such effects. Specifically, we investigate the impact of the redshifted lens mass MLz ∈ [3 × 105, 3 × 107] M⊙, the dimensionless impact parameter y is scaled in terms of the Einstein radius of the lens with y ∈ [10, 50], the source redshift zs ∈ [4, 6], and the total source mass Ms ∈ [105, 107] M⊙ on parameter estimation and model selection. Our results indicate that larger MLz values reduce the fitting factor ( ), thereby amplifying the waveform residual and its associated residual signal-to-noise ratio ( ), which enhances the ability to distinguish between lensed and unlensed models. Conversely, for y ≥ 50, the approaches 1 and becomes too small to allow effective model discrimination. For y ≤ 30, the degeneracy between the luminosity distance dL and MLz can be effectively broken. While the Bayes factor decreases with increasing source redshift zs, lensing signatures remain identifiable up to zs = 6. The influence of the total source mass Ms depends on the overlap of the GW signal with the detector’s sensitive band. Overall, effective model discrimination generally requires an (corresponding to for the results presented in this work).</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ae29ad</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] First Results from the PanRadio Gamma-Ray Burst Collaboration: The 400-day Afterglow of GRB 230815A</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2c8a</link><description>We introduce the PanRadio Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) program carried out on the Australia Telescope Compact Array: a systematic, multiyear, radio survey of all southern Swift GRB events, comprehensively following the multifrequency evolution of their afterglows from within an hour to years postburst. We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of the long-duration (collapsar) GRB 230815A—the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB 230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multiwavelength follow-up, due to its high line-of-sight extinction with AV = 2.3. We found its early X-ray jet break at ∼0.1 days postburst to be at odds with the evolution of the multifrequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of 400 days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to the jet break, showing no evidence for evolutions of the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle of ∼2 1, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle of ⪆35°. The PanRadio GRB program will establish a sample of comprehensively followed GRBs, where a rigorous inspection of their microphysical and dynamical parameters can be performed, thereby revealing the diversity of features in their outflows and environments.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2c8a</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2d19</link><description>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and transient productions. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies, measuring oxygen abundances ( –8.85) for 31 hosts at redshifts z = 0.04–0.98, using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies selected by the same criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide metallicity range and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass–metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. We find no clear lower metallicity bound, suggesting that FRB progenitors can form in any metallicity environment through channels largely insensitive to metal abundance. Encouragingly, this implies that FRBs can arise even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal (∼2σ) evidence for a −0.09 ± 0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation. Despite model uncertainties, if real, this offset likely reflects suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. Similar offsets are observed in local post-merger galaxies and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions. Such systems may host FRB progenitors formed during the starburst that produce FRBs after a 100–500 Myr delay, broadly consistent with observed delay-time distributions, although further data are needed to confirm this interpretation.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2d19</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] A Spatial Gap in the Sky Distribution of Fast Radio Burst Detections Coinciding with Galactic Plasma Overdensities</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2eb3</link><description>We analyze the positional and morphological properties of about 3600 unique fast radio burst (FRB) sources reported in the second FRB catalog generated by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) telescope. We find a two-dimensional dependence of FRB detections on sky position and identify a significant absence of detections in a roughly circular region centered at Galactic coordinates (77 7, 0 9), spanning an area of 213.6 deg2. This detection gap spatially coincides with the Cygnus X region—a plasma-rich star-forming region in the Milky Way. This feature is most likely the result of increased sky temperature and strong multipath scattering by turbulent ionized plasma, which broadens the FRB signals beyond detectability in the CHIME band. Our simulations yield a mean of six expected FRB detections within the gap when accounting for the elevated sky temperature in the direction of the detection gap. We infer that a lower limit of the maximum scattering timescale τsc, 1 GHz ≥ 5.59 ms, obtained without assuming a model of the Galactic electron distribution, is sufficient to suppress the brightness of all coincident FRBs. A similar suppression is seen in Catalog 2 along other high emission measure (EM) sight lines (i.e., EM ≥ 2900 pc cm−6), further supporting a broader trend of suppression due to Galactic scattering. Future very long baseline interferometry measurements of scattering disks with CHIME Outriggers can help confirm our interpretation. Our work highlights the notion that FRBs can serve as new, model-independent tracers of the warm ionized medium within our Galaxy.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Letters - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2eb3</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] JWST Spectroscopy of GRB 250702B: An Extremely Rare and Exceptionally Energetic Burst in a Dusty, Massive Galaxy at z = 1.036</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ae2ed9</link><description>We present follow-up observations of the day-long, repeating gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 250702B with the Near Infrared Spectrograph on board the James Webb Space Telescope. Through the identification of narrow hydrogen emission lines at a consistent redshift of z = 1.036 ± 0.004, we calibrate the distance scale, and therefore the energetics, of this unique extragalactic transient. At this distance, the resulting γ-ray energy release is at least Eγ,iso = 2.2 × 1054 erg. We find no evidence for ongoing transient emission at the GRB position and exclude any accompanying supernova (SN) with a luminosity comparable to the Type Ic broad-line SN 2023lcr, though we are unable to rule out a fainter SN counterpart owing to high extinction. The inferred rate of such events, assuming at most one in the lifetime of Fermi, suggests that such bursts are very rare, with volumetric rates over 1000 times lower than normal high-luminosity long GRBs and &gt;105 times lower than core-collapse SNe, when corrected for beaming. Furthermore, we find that the host galaxy is unique among GRB host galaxies and extremely rare in the general galaxy population, being extremely large and dusty and with high stellar mass.

However, stellar variability can have major consequences for the evolution of planetary climates. In this work, we evaluate how stellar variability influences the equilibrium temperature and water retention of planets within the habitable zone (HZ). We present a sample of nine stars that are known to host at least one planet within the HZ and that were identified to have a variability amplitude exceeding 100 ppm based on photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. We investigate the effect that the variability of these stars has on the insolation flux of their HZ planets and the resulting changes in the induced planetary equilibrium temperature. Our results show that for the stars in our sample, the stellar variability has an insignificant effect on the equilibrium temperature of HZ planets. However, we also emphasize that these stars are not representative of more extreme variable stars, since exoplanets are more difficult to detect and characterize in the presence of extreme variability. We also investigate the equilibrium temperature and long-term evolution of a hypothetical Earth-like planet placed at the inner edge of the HZ around a highly variable star. We found that the water loss rates are comparable between both variable and quiet host stars for Earth-like planets in the inner HZ. Overall, these results broaden our knowledge of the impact of stellar variability on planetary habitability.</description><author>The Astronomical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae246e</guid></item><item><title>[The Astronomica] Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and ρ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool Dwarfs (KOINTREAU) I: A Planetary-mass Companion and a Disk-obscured Stellar Companion Discovered in Taurus</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae267f</link><description>We present the first discoveries from Keck Observations in the Infrared of Taurus and ρ Oph Exoplanets and Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics imaging survey of young stars in the Taurus and ρ Oph star-forming regions using the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor. We have found two faint (ΔK∼7 mag), wide-separation companions to two ≈3 Myr old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems shows that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using the Infrared Telescope Facility/SpeX (R ∼100) and the Gemini North InfraRed Spectrograph (Gemini/GNIRS; R ∼ 1000–2000), and combined these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-infrared spectral type of M9 ± 2, a gravity classification of vl-g, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object’s mass to be MJup, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5 ± 1 but is ≈4 mag underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 μm emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging, which shows a 0 118 difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution.</description><author>The Astronomical Journal - latest papers</author><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ae267f</guid></item><item><title>[Research in Ast] The Influential Roles of Gravity, Turbulence, and Magnetic Fields in Shaping the Physical Evolution of Dense Massive Clumps</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/ae278c</link><description>We explore the roles of the three competitors, namely, gravity, turbulence, and magnetic fields, in controlling star formation within dense, massive clumps identified in the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy survey. By examining scaling relations, virial parameters, and turbulent energy spectra, we evaluate the dynamical state of these clumps. We observe a weak velocity dispersion–size relation (σ ∝ L0.11), which is much shallower than the classical Larson-like relations, suggesting that turbulence does not mainly drive internal dynamics. The turbulent energy spectrum, E(k) ∝ k−1.21, is also less steep than what is expected for both incompressible and compressible turbulence. We equally observe a decreasing trend in the virial parameter with increasing mass (αvir ∝ M−0.37), indicating that more massive clumps are increasingly gravitationally bound. These trends indicate an increasing relative dominance of gravity over turbulence at smaller scales, aligning with multiscale collapse scenarios; however, the absolute energy balance remains unquantifiable with the current data. Although magnetic fields are not directly measured, their potential influence is considered in the interpretation of pressure balance and dynamical support. Our findings imply that gravitational processes appear to primarily regulate the structure and evolution of massive clumps.</description><author>Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1674-4527/ae278c</guid></item><item><title>[Recent Articles] Convective stability analysis of massive neutron stars formed in binary mergers</title><link>http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/w8gq-3d54</link><description>Author(s): Yong Gao, Kota Hayashi, Kenta Kiuchi, Alan Tsz-Lok Lam, Hao-Jui Kuan, and Masaru Shibata&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We perform fully general-relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of binary neutron star mergers over 100 ms postmerger to investigate the dynamics of remnant massive neutron stars (NSs).

Key innovations of J-HERTz include Bayesian neural network classifications for 390,000 galaxies, 31,000 quasars, and 20,000 stars, along with significantly improved photometric redshifts for 235,000 galaxies compared to previous J-PLUS DR3 and LoTSS DR2 estimates. We identify 831 candidate Galactic radio stars, which, if confirmed, would constitute a significant addition to the number of radio-emitting stars identified to date. Among radio-loud galaxies with spectroscopic observations, ≳20% lack Seyfert or LINER signatures, indicating a substantial population of optically quiescent radio galaxies, in agreement with previous works. Spectral energy distribution fitting of their host galaxies using J-PLUS photospectra reveals systematically low specific star formation rates, consistent with quenched stellar populations. J-HERTz thus provides a powerful data set to exploit radio-optical synergies, enabling studies that span from the origin of stellar radio emission to the active galactic nucleus life cycle and the role of jet activity in shaping host galaxy evolution.</description><author>The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series - latest papers</author><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jan 2026 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae2016</guid></item><item><title>[The Astrophysic] The Green Bank Ammonia Survey: Data Release 2</title><link>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ae11b1</link><description>We present an overview of the final data release (DR2) from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey (GAS). GAS is a large program at the Green Bank Telescope to map all Gould Belt star-forming regions with AV ≳ 7 mag visible from the Northern Hemisphere in emission from NH3 and other key molecular tracers. This final release includes the data for all the regions observed: Heiles Cloud 2 and B18 in Taurus; Barnard 1, Barnard 1-E, IC 348, NGC 1333, L1448, L1451, and Per7/34 in Perseus; L1688 and L1689 in Ophiuchus; Orion A (North and South) and Orion B in Orion; Cepheus; B59 in Pipe; Corona Australis East and West; IC 5146; and Serpens Aquila and MWC297 in Serpens. Similar to what was presented in GAS DR1, we find that the NH3 emission and dust continuum emission from Herschel correspond closely. We find that the NH3 emission is generally extended beyond the typical 0.1 pc length scales of dense cores, and we find that the transition between coherent core and turbulent cloud is a common result. This shows that the regions of coherence are common throughout different star-forming regions, with a substantial fraction of the high column density regions displaying subsonic nonthermal velocity dispersions. We produce maps of the gas kinematics, temperature, and NH3 column densities through forward modeling of the hyperfine structure of the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) lines. We show that the NH3 velocity dispersion, σv, and gas kinetic temperature, TK, vary systematically between the regions included in this release, with an increase in both the mean value and spread of σv and TK with increasing star formation activity.

These interactions lead to slow changes in the orbit and angular momentum vector of Earth, and correspondingly influence Earth’s climate evolution. Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth’s orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by g2 (Venus) and g5 (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the ∼100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by g4 (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet g-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of g4 with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth’s obliquity cycles driven by s3 (Earth) and s4 (Mars) lengthen from the canonical ∼41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45–55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars’ mass controls the architecture of Earth’s climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood.</description><author>Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific - latest papers</author><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2025 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="true">https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/ae2800</guid></item></channel></rss>
